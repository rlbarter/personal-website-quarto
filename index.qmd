Purrr is the tidyverse's answer to apply functions for iteration. It's one of those packages that you might have heard of, but seemed too complicated to sit down and learn. Starting with map functions, and taking you on a journey that will harness the power of the list, this post will have you purrring in no time.

[**Understanding Instrumental Variables**](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2018-05-23-instrumental_variables/)
:::

::: card-body

Instrumental variables is one of the most mystical concepts in causal inference. For some reason, most of the existing explanations are overly complicated and focus on specific nuanced aspects of generating IV estimates without really providing the intuition for why it makes sense. In this post, you will not find too many technical details, but rather a narrative introducing instruments and why they are useful.
