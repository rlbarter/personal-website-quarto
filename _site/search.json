    "text": "Note: Scoped verbs have now essentially been superseded by accross() (soon to be available in dplyr 1.0.0). See http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-07-09-across/ for details.\nI often find myself wishing that I could apply the same mutate function to several columns in a data frame at once, such as convert all factors to characters, or do something to all columns that have missing values, or select all variables whose names end with _important. When I first googled these problems around a year ago, I started to see solutions that use weird extensions of the basic mutate(), select(), rename(), and summarise() dplyr functions that look like summarise_all(), filter_at(), mutate_if(), and so on. I have since learned that these functions are called “scoped verbs” (where “scoped” means that they operate only on a selection of variables).\nUnfortunately, despite my extensive googling, I never really found a satisfactory description of how to use these functions in general, I think primarily because the documentation for these functions is not particularly useful (try ?mutate_at()).\nFortunately, I recently attended a series of lightening talks hosted by the RLadies SF chapter where Sara Altman pointed us towards a summary document that Hadley Wickham wrote for the Data Science class he helped create at Stanford in 2017 (this class is now taught by Sara Altman herself).\nTo summarise what I will demonstrate below, there are three scoped variants of the standard mutate, summarise, rename and select (and transmute) dplyr functions that can be specified by the following suffixes:\nTo explain how these functions all work, I will use the dataset from a survey of 800 Pittsburgh residents on whether or not they approve of self-driving car companies testing their autonomous vehicles on the streets of Pittsburgh (there have several articles on this issue in recent times in case you missed them: 1, 2). The data can usually be downloaded from data.gov (but is currently unavailable due to the current Government Shutdown - I will update this with an actual link to the data one day). For now you can download the data from here.\nA random sample of 10 rows of this dataset is shown below. To make it easy to see what’s going on, I’ll restrict my analysis below to these 10 rows"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I graduated with a PhD from UC Berkeley’s statistics department in December. My PhD dissertation consisted of three 100% applied projects (one of which was a piece of open-source software). This is, unfortunately, incredibly rare.\nOver the past few years, I’ve had a number of current and prospective statistics PhD students both at Berkeley and outside Berkeley get in touch with me to ask me how I made my way through a statistics PhD by working only on applied projects. My answer is always as follows: I got lucky. I ended up with an incredibly supportive and advisor, Bin Yu, who went out of her way to find applied projects for me, and was comfortable letting me spend time doing non-conventional things (like learn D3.js, work on my blog, and she even recruited me to be the co-author on a book on Data Science that she wanted to write based on her data science philosophy that she has developed throughout her career). I got a lot out of my PhD, and I’m incredibly grateful to Bin for her guidance. If you’re interested in Bin’s work, I recommend reading her paper, Veridical Data Science, which reflects the philosophy that underlies our book.\nUnfortunately, my experience is definitely not the norm, even in my own department. I’ve had so many upsetting conversations with fellow applied stats grad students about how they feel lost and unsupported, about how they’re struggling to find applied projects to work on, and when they do finally find a project, they end up having to fight to justify that their project is “statistical enough” to count towards their dissertation. I’ve had these conversations with students from a wide range of statistics departments, not just my own. I actually think that the Berkeley statistics department is a little better than a many other statistics departments on this front - at least at Berkeley it’s possible to graduate with purely applied projects, even if it’s not easy.\nWhile pretty much every statistics department is starting to realize that they need to embrace “Data Science” in order to remain up-to-date and relevant, they are often doing so in a way that is more performative than practical. They’re starting data science master’s programs, but these programs are often just theoretical statistics programs with a “data science” label slapped on it. They’re also trying to recruit more applied students, but they aren’t giving them any of the support they need to be successful. How can you expect your applied students to succeed if you don’t have any truly applied faculty to guide them? And when you do have applied faculty, you don’t give them tenure (because apparently they’re not “furthering the field of statistics”)? Who are these students going to work with? Who is going to show them that it’s possible to succeed as an applied statistician in a statistics department? Unfortunately, the vast majority of statistics departments are sending a strong message that there is no such thing as success in academia for truly applied statisticians. The end result is that applied students are being brought into statistics departments, chewed up a little, and then spat out, often with a fair amount of imposter syndrome, anxiety and depression, and sadly, often without their PhDs.\nMaybe at this point you’re getting aggravated and saying: “but most statistics departments do have applied statisticians on their faculty!”. Well, yes, technically that’s true, if your definition of “applied statistics” involves developing a method (or even developing the underlying theory for a method) and then applying it to a nice, clean dataset to show that the method works. What about answering scientific questions and actually solving real-world problems? What about working with real, messy data? What about communication, exploration, and visualization? Are none of these things statistics?\nIn my view, this failure to embrace truly applied projects as applied statistics is the whole reason Data Science exists. Data Science is what “Applied Statistics” is supposed to be. Didn’t statistics come about in the first place because governments started collecting and analyzing real data to understand their citizens? Sure, they developed methods, but these methods were developed specifically because they were needed to solve real problems! Why is it that today, when grad students want to solve real problems, they’re told that they aren’t doing statistics?\nI’m not saying that theory and methods aren’t an important part of statistics, or that having a theoretical background doesn’t help if you want to be an accomplished data scientist. What I’m saying is that theory shouldn’t always be the focus. If you want to support your applied statistics students (or data science students), then you need to have a track in your program that teaches students how to use real world (and messy!) data to ask scientific questions, and communicate about data and the subsequent scientific findings (I could do a whole post on how most statisticians can’t communicate, but I’ll leave that for another day). For that to happen, you need to hire truly applied faculty, who are working on real world problems with real, messy data.\nUnfortunately, it’s a bit of a Catch-22. How can you hire more applied faculty if by the time us applied students get out of your programs, we’re so fed up with feeling like the under-class in statistics departments that we have no desire to go down the academic route whatsoever? Statistics, I’ll leave you with two pieces of advice:\n\nSupport your applied students. Let them do applied work, and help them find projects in collaboration with faculty in other departments. Let them graduate, and don’t make them fight for it. Give them a positive grad school experience, rather than leave them with nightmares.\nSeek out applied faculty candidates. And when you hire them, actually give them f**king tenure."

Rowling\nPurrr is one of those tidyverse packages that you keep hearing about, and you know you should probably learn it, but you just never seem to get around to it.\nAt it’s core, purrr is all about iteration. Purrr introduces map functions (the tidyverse’s answer to base R’s apply functions, but more in line with functional programming practices) as well as some new functions for manipulating lists. To get a quick snapshot of any tidyverse package, a nice place to go is the cheatsheet. I find these particularly useful after I’ve already got the basics of a package down, because I inevitably realise that there are a bunch of functionalities I knew nothing about.\nAnother useful resource for learning about purrr is Jenny Bryan’s tutorial. Jenny’s tutorial is fantastic, but is a lot longer than mine. This post is a lot shorter and my goal is to get you up and running with purrr very quickly.\nWhile the workhorse of dplyr is the data frame, the workhorse of purrr is the list. If you aren’t familiar with lists, hopefully this will help you understand what they are:\nHere is an example of a list that has three elements: a single number, a vector and a data frame\nNote that a data frame is actually a special case of a list where each element of the list is a vector of the same length."

    "text": "Simplest usage: repeated looping with map\nFundamentally, maps are for iteration. In the example below I will iterate through the vector c(1, 4, 7) by adding 10 to each entry. This function applied to a single number, which we will call .x, can be defined as\n\naddTen <- function(.x) {\n  return(.x + 10)\n}\n\nThe map() function below iterates addTen() across all entries of the vector, .x = c(1, 4, 7), and returns the output as a list\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmap(.x = c(1, 4, 7), \n    .f = addTen)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 11\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 14\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 17\n\n\nFortunately, you don’t actually need to specify the argument names\n\nmap(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 11\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 14\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 17\n\n\nNote that\n\nthe first element of the output is the result of applying the function to the first element of the input (1),\nthe second element of the output is the result of applying the function to the second element of the input (4),\nand the third element of the output is the result of applying the function to the third element of the input (7).\n\nThe following code chunks show that no matter if the input object is a vector, a list, or a data frame, map() always returns a list.\n\nmap(list(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 11\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 14\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 17\n\n\n\nmap(data.frame(a = 1, b = 4, c = 7), addTen)\n\n$a\n[1] 11\n\n$b\n[1] 14\n\n$c\n[1] 17\n\n\nIf we wanted the output of map to be some other object type, we need to use a different function. For instance to map the input to a numeric (double) vector, you can use the map_dbl() (“map to a double”) function.\n\nmap_dbl(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n[1] 11 14 17\n\n\nTo map to a character vector, you can use the map_chr() (“map to a character”) function.\n\nmap_chr(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\nWarning: Automatic coercion from double to character was deprecated in purrr 1.0.0.\nℹ Please use an explicit call to `as.character()` within `map_chr()` instead.\n\n\n[1] \"11.000000\" \"14.000000\" \"17.000000\"\n\n\nIf you want to return a data frame, then you would use the map_df() function. However, you need to make sure that in each iteration you’re returning a data frame which has consistent column names. map_df will automatically bind the rows of each iteration.\nFor this example, I want to return a data frame whose columns correspond to the original number and the number plus ten.\n\nmap_df(c(1, 4, 7), function(.x) {\n  return(data.frame(old_number = .x, \n                    new_number = addTen(.x)))\n})\n\n  old_number new_number\n1          1         11\n2          4         14\n3          7         17\n\n\nNote that in this case, I defined an “anonymous” function as our output for each iteration. An anonymous function is a temporary function (that you define as the function argument to the map). Here I used the argument name .x, but I could have used anything.\nAnother function to be aware of is modify(), which is just like the map functions, but always returns an object the same type as the input object.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmodify(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n[1] 11 14 17\n\n\n\nmodify(list(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 11\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 14\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 17\n\n\n\nmodify(data.frame(1, 4, 7), addTen)\n\n  X1 X4 X7\n1 11 14 17\n\n\nModify also has a pretty useful sibling, modify_if(), that only applies the function to elements that satisfy a specific criteria (specified by a “predicate function”, the second argument called .p). For instance, the following example only modifies the third entry since it is greater than 5.\n\nmodify_if(.x = list(1, 4, 7), \n          .p = function(x) x > 5,\n          .f = addTen)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 17"

    "text": "Applying map functions in a slightly more interesting context\nThroughout this tutorial, we will use the gapminder dataset that can be loaded directly if you’re connected to the internet. Each function will first be demonstrated using a simple numeric example, and then will be demonstrated using a more complex practical example based on the gapminder dataset.\nMy general workflow involves loading the original data and saving it as an object with a meaningful name and an _orig suffix. I then define a copy of the original dataset without the _orig suffix. Having an original copy of my data in my environment means that it is easy to check that my manipulations do what I expected. I will make direct data cleaning modifications to the gapminder data frame, but will never edit the gapminder_orig data frame.\n\n# to download the data directly:\ngapminder_orig <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv\")\n# define a copy of the original dataset that we will clean and play with \ngapminder <- gapminder_orig\n\nThe gapminder dataset has 1704 rows containing information on population, life expectancy and GDP per capita by year and country.\nA “tidy” data frame is one where every row is a single observational unit (in this case, indexed by country and year), and every column corresponds to a variable that is measured for each observational unit (in this case, for each country and year, a measurement is made for population, continent, life expectancy and GDP). If you’d like to learn more about “tidy data”, I highly recommend reading Hadley Wickham’s tidy data article.\n\ndim(gapminder)\n\n[1] 1704    6\n\nhead(gapminder)\n\n      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453\n2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530\n3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007\n4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971\n5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811\n6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134\n\n\nSince gapminder is a data frame, the map_ functions will iterate over each column. An example of simple usage of the map_ functions is to summarize each column. For instance, you can identify the type of each column by applying the class() function to each column. Since the output of the class() function is a character, we will use the map_chr() function:\n\n# apply the class() function to each column\ngapminder %>% map_chr(class)\n\n    country        year         pop   continent     lifeExp   gdpPercap \n\"character\"   \"integer\"   \"numeric\" \"character\"   \"numeric\"   \"numeric\" \n\n\nI frequently do this to get a quick snapshot of each column type of a new dataset directly in the console. As a habit, I usually pipe in the data using %>%, rather than provide it as an argument. Remember that the pipe places the object to the left of the pipe in the first argument of the function to the right.\nSimilarly, if you wanted to identify the number of distinct values in each column, you could apply the n_distinct() function from the dplyr package to each column. Since the output of n_distinct() is a numeric (a double), you might want to use the map_dbl() function so that the results of each iteration (the application of n_distinct() to each column) are concatenated into a numeric vector:\n\n# apply the n_distinct() function to each column\ngapminder %>% map_dbl(n_distinct)\n\n  country      year       pop continent   lifeExp gdpPercap \n      142        12      1704         5      1626      1704 \n\n\nIf you want to do something a little more complicated, such return a few different summaries of each column in a data frame, you can use map_df(). When things are getting a little bit more complicated, you typically need to define an anonymous function that you want to apply to each column. Using the tilde-dot notation, the anonymous function below calculates the number of distinct entries and the type of the current column (which is accessible as .x), and then combines them into a two-column data frame. Once it has iterated through each of the columns, the map_df function combines the data frames row-wise into a single data frame.\n\ngapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),\n                                  class = class(.x))))\n\n  n_distinct     class\n1        142 character\n2         12   integer\n3       1704   numeric\n4          5 character\n5       1626   numeric\n6       1704   numeric\n\n\nNote that we’ve lost the variable names! The variable names correspond to the names of the objects over which we are iterating (in this case, the column names), and these are not automatically included as a column in the output data frame. You can tell map_df() to include them using the .id argument of map_df(). This will automatically take the name of the element being iterated over and include it in the column corresponding to whatever you set .id to.\n\ngapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),\n                                  class = class(.x))),\n                     .id = \"variable\")\n\n   variable n_distinct     class\n1   country        142 character\n2      year         12   integer\n3       pop       1704   numeric\n4 continent          5 character\n5   lifeExp       1626   numeric\n6 gdpPercap       1704   numeric\n\n\nIf you’re having trouble thinking through these map actions, I recommend that you first figure out what the code would be to do what you want for a single element, and then paste it into the map_df() function (a nice trick I saw Hadley Wickham used a few years ago when he presented on purrr at RLadies SF).\nFor instance, since the first element of the gapminder data frame is the first column, let’s define .x in our environment to be this first column.\n\n# take the first element of the gapminder data\n.x <- gapminder %>% pluck(1)\n# look at the first 6 rows\nhead(.x)\n\n[1] \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\"\n[6] \"Afghanistan\"\n\n\nThen, you can create a data frame for this column that contains the number of distinct entries, and the class of the column.\n\ndata.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),\n           class = class(.x))\n\n  n_distinct     class\n1        142 character\n\n\nSince this has done what was expected want for the first column, you can paste this code into the map function using the tilde-dot shorthand.\n\ngapminder %>% map_df(~(data.frame(n_distinct = n_distinct(.x),\n                                  class = class(.x))),\n                     .id = \"variable\")\n\n   variable n_distinct     class\n1   country        142 character\n2      year         12   integer\n3       pop       1704   numeric\n4 continent          5 character\n5   lifeExp       1626   numeric\n6 gdpPercap       1704   numeric\n\n\nmap_df() is definitely one of the most powerful functions of purrr in my opinion, and is probably the one that I use most."

For instance, what if you want to perform a map that iterates through two objects. The code below uses map functions to create a list of plots that compare life expectancy and GDP per capita for each continent/year combination.\nThe map function that maps over two objects instead of 1 is called map2(). The first two arguments are the two objects you want to iterate over, and the third is the function (with two arguments, one for each object).\n\nmap2(.x = object1, # the first object to iterate over\n     .y = object2, # the second object to iterate over\n     .f = plotFunction(.x, .y))\n\nFirst, you need to define a vector (or list) of continents and a paired vector (or list) of years that you want to iterate through. Note that in our continent/year example\n\nthe first iteration will correspond to the first continent in the continent vector and the first year in the year vector,\nthe second iteration will correspond to the second continent in the continent vector and the second year in the year vector.\n\nThis might seem obvious, but it is a natural instinct to incorrectly assume that map2() will automatically perform the action on all combinations that can be made from the two vectors. For instance if you have a continent vector .x = c(\"Americas\", \"Asia\") and a year vector .y = c(1952, 2007), then you might assume that map2 will iterate over the Americas for 1952 and for 2007, and then Asia for 1952 and 2007. It won’t though. The iteration will actually be first the Americas for 1952 only, and then Asia for 2007 only.\nFirst, let’s get our vectors of continents and years, starting by obtaining all distinct combinations of continents and years that appear in the data.\n\ncontinent_year <- gapminder %>% distinct(continent, year)\ncontinent_year\n\n   continent year\n1       Asia 1952\n2       Asia 1957\n3       Asia 1962\n4       Asia 1967\n5       Asia 1972\n6       Asia 1977\n7       Asia 1982\n8       Asia 1987\n9       Asia 1992\n10      Asia 1997\n11      Asia 2002\n12      Asia 2007\n13    Europe 1952\n14    Europe 1957\n15    Europe 1962\n16    Europe 1967\n17    Europe 1972\n18    Europe 1977\n19    Europe 1982\n20    Europe 1987\n21    Europe 1992\n22    Europe 1997\n23    Europe 2002\n24    Europe 2007\n25    Africa 1952\n26    Africa 1957\n27    Africa 1962\n28    Africa 1967\n29    Africa 1972\n30    Africa 1977\n31    Africa 1982\n32    Africa 1987\n33    Africa 1992\n34    Africa 1997\n35    Africa 2002\n36    Africa 2007\n37  Americas 1952\n38  Americas 1957\n39  Americas 1962\n40  Americas 1967\n41  Americas 1972\n42  Americas 1977\n43  Americas 1982\n44  Americas 1987\n45  Americas 1992\n46  Americas 1997\n47  Americas 2002\n48  Americas 2007\n49   Oceania 1952\n50   Oceania 1957\n51   Oceania 1962\n52   Oceania 1967\n53   Oceania 1972\n54   Oceania 1977\n55   Oceania 1982\n56   Oceania 1987\n57   Oceania 1992\n58   Oceania 1997\n59   Oceania 2002\n60   Oceania 2007\n\n\nThen extracting the continent and year pairs as separate vectors\n\n# extract the continent and year pairs as separate vectors\ncontinents <- continent_year %>% pull(continent) %>% as.character\nyears <- continent_year %>% pull(year)\n\nIf you want to use tilde-dot short-hand, the anonymous arguments will be .x for the first object being iterated over, and .y for the second object being iterated over.\nBefore jumping straight into the map function, it’s a good idea to first figure out what the code will be for just first iteration (the first continent and the first year, which happen to be Asia in 1952).\n\n# try to figure out the code for the first example\n.x <- continents[1]\n.y <- years[1]\n# make a scatterplot of GDP vs life expectancy in all Asian countries for 1952\ngapminder %>% \n  filter(continent == .x,\n         year == .y) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  ggtitle(glue::glue(.x, \" \", .y))\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to have worked.

To see this, the code below shows that the first entry in the data column corresponds to the entire gapminder dataset for Asia.\n\ngapminder_nested$data[[1]]\n\n# A tibble: 396 × 5\n   country      year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   <chr>       <int>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333    28.8      779.\n 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934    30.3      821.\n 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083    32.0      853.\n 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966    34.0      836.\n 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460    36.1      740.\n 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372    38.4      786.\n 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816    39.9      978.\n 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957    40.8      852.\n 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921    41.7      649.\n10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415    41.8      635.\n# … with 386 more rows\n\n\nUsing dplyr pluck() function, this can be written as\n\ngapminder_nested %>% \n  # extract the first entry from the data column\n  pluck(\"data\", 1)\n\n# A tibble: 396 × 5\n   country      year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   <chr>       <int>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333    28.8      779.\n 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934    30.3      821.\n 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083    32.0      853.\n 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966    34.0      836.\n 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460    36.1      740.\n 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372    38.4      786.\n 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816    39.9      978.\n 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957    40.8      852.\n 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921    41.7      649.\n10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415    41.8      635.\n# … with 386 more rows\n\n\nSimilarly, the 5th entry in the data column corresponds to the entire gapminder dataset for Oceania.\n\ngapminder_nested %>% pluck(\"data\", 5)\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 5\n   country    year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   <chr>     <int>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Australia  1952  8691212    69.1    10040.\n 2 Australia  1957  9712569    70.3    10950.\n 3 Australia  1962 10794968    70.9    12217.\n 4 Australia  1967 11872264    71.1    14526.\n 5 Australia  1972 13177000    71.9    16789.\n 6 Australia  1977 14074100    73.5    18334.\n 7 Australia  1982 15184200    74.7    19477.\n 8 Australia  1987 16257249    76.3    21889.\n 9 Australia  1992 17481977    77.6    23425.\n10 Australia  1997 18565243    78.8    26998.\n# … with 14 more rows\n\n\nYou might be asking at this point why you would ever want to nest your data frame? It just doesn’t seem like that useful a thing to do… until you realise that you now have the power to use dplyr manipulations on more complex objects that can be stored in a list.\nHowever, since actions such as mutate() are applied directly to the entire column (which is usually a vector, so is fine), we run into issues when we try to mutate a list. For instance, since columns are usually vectors, normal vectorized functions work just fine on them\n\ntibble(vec_col = 1:10) %>%\n  mutate(vec_sum = sum(vec_col))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   vec_col vec_sum\n     <int>   <int>\n 1       1      55\n 2       2      55\n 3       3      55\n 4       4      55\n 5       5      55\n 6       6      55\n 7       7      55\n 8       8      55\n 9       9      55\n10      10      55\n\n\nbut when the column is a list, vectorized functions don’t know what to do with them, and we get an error that says Error in sum(x) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument. Try\n\ntibble(list_col = list(c(1, 5, 7), \n                       5, \n                       c(10, 10, 11))) %>%\n  mutate(list_sum = sum(list_col))\n\nTo apply mutate functions to a list-column, you need to wrap the function you want to apply in a map function.\n\ntibble(list_col = list(c(1, 5, 7), \n                       5, \n                       c(10, 10, 11))) %>%\n  mutate(list_sum = map(list_col, sum))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  list_col  list_sum \n  <list>    <list>   \n1 <dbl [3]> <dbl [1]>\n2 <dbl [1]> <dbl [1]>\n3 <dbl [3]> <dbl [1]>\n\n\nSince map() returns a list itself, the list_sum column is thus itself a list\n\ntibble(list_col = list(c(1, 5, 7), \n                       5, \n                       c(10, 10, 11))) %>%\n  mutate(list_sum = map(list_col, sum)) %>% \n  pull(list_sum)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 13\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 5\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 31\n\n\nWhat could we do if we wanted it to be a vector? We could use the map_dbl() function instead!\n\ntibble(list_col = list(c(1, 5, 7), \n                       5, \n                       c(10, 10, 11))) %>%\n  mutate(list_sum = map_dbl(list_col, sum))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  list_col  list_sum\n  <list>       <dbl>\n1 <dbl [3]>       13\n2 <dbl [1]>        5\n3 <dbl [3]>       31\n\n\n\nNesting the gapminder data\nLet’s return to the nested gapminder dataset. I want to calculate the average life expectancy within each continent and add it as a new column using mutate(). Based on the example above, can you explain why the following code doesn’t work?\n\ngapminder_nested %>% \n  mutate(avg_lifeExp = mean(data$lifeExp))\n\nI was hoping that this code would extract the lifeExp column from each data frame. But I’m applying the mutate to the data column, which itself doesn’t have an entry called lifeExp since it’s a list of data frames. How could I get access to the lifeExp column of the data frames stored in the data list? Using a map function of course!\nThink of an individual data frame as .x. Again, I will first figure out the code for calculating the mean life expectancy for the first entry of the column. The following code defines .x to be the first entry of the data column (this is the data frame for Asia).\n\n# the first entry of the \"data\" column\n.x <- gapminder_nested %>% pluck(\"data\", 1)\n.x\n\n# A tibble: 396 × 5\n   country      year      pop lifeExp gdpPercap\n   <chr>       <int>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333    28.8      779.\n 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934    30.3      821.\n 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083    32.0      853.\n 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966    34.0      836.\n 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460    36.1      740.\n 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372    38.4      786.\n 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816    39.9      978.\n 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957    40.8      852.\n 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921    41.7      649.\n10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415    41.8      635.\n# … with 386 more rows\n\n\nThen to calculate the average life expectancy for Asia, I could write\n\nmean(.x$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 60.0649\n\n\nSo copy-pasting this into the tilde-dot anonymous function argument of the map_dbl() function within mutate(), I get what I wanted!\n\ngapminder_nested %>% \n  mutate(avg_lifeExp = map_dbl(data, ~{mean(.x$lifeExp)}))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n# Groups:   continent [5]\n  continent data               avg_lifeExp\n  <chr>     <list>                   <dbl>\n1 Asia      <tibble [396 × 5]>        60.1\n2 Europe    <tibble [360 × 5]>        71.9\n3 Africa    <tibble [624 × 5]>        48.9\n4 Americas  <tibble [300 × 5]>        64.7\n5 Oceania   <tibble [24 × 5]>         74.3\n\n\nThis code iterates through the data frames stored in the data column, returns the average life expectancy for each data frame, and concatonates the results into a numeric vector (which is then stored as a column called avg_lifeExp).\nI hear what you’re saying… this is something that we could have done a lot more easily using standard dplyr commands (such as summarise()). True, but hopefully it helped you understand why you need to wrap mutate functions inside map functions when applying them to list columns.\nEven if this example was less than inspiring, I promise the next example will knock your socks off!\nThe next exampe will demonstrate how to fit a model separately for each continent, and evaluate it, all within a single tibble. First, I will fit a linear model for each continent and store it as a list-column. If the data frame for a single continent is .x, then the model I want to fit is lm(lifeExp ~ pop + gdpPercap + year, data = .x) (check for yourself that this does what you expect). So I can copy-past this command into the map() function within the mutate()\n\n# fit a model separately for each continent\ngapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% \n  mutate(lm_obj = map(data, ~lm(lifeExp ~ pop + gdpPercap + year, data = .x)))\ngapminder_nested\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n# Groups:   continent [5]\n  continent data               lm_obj\n  <chr>     <list>             <list>\n1 Asia      <tibble [396 × 5]> <lm>  \n2 Europe    <tibble [360 × 5]> <lm>  \n3 Africa    <tibble [624 × 5]> <lm>  \n4 Americas  <tibble [300 × 5]> <lm>  \n5 Oceania   <tibble [24 × 5]>  <lm>  \n\n\nWhere the first linear model (for Asia) is\n\ngapminder_nested %>% pluck(\"lm_obj\", 1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = lifeExp ~ pop + gdpPercap + year, data = .x)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          pop    gdpPercap         year  \n -7.833e+02    4.228e-11    2.510e-04    4.251e-01  \n\n\nI can then predict the response for the data stored in the data column using the corresponding linear model. So I have two objects I want to iterate over: the data and the linear model object. This means I want to use map2(). When things get a little more complicated I like to have multiple function arguments, so I’m going to use a full anonymous function rather than the tilde-dot shorthand.\n\n# predict the response for each continent\ngapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% \n  mutate(pred = map2(lm_obj, data, function(.lm, .data) predict(.lm, .data)))\ngapminder_nested\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Groups:   continent [5]\n  continent data               lm_obj pred       \n  <chr>     <list>             <list> <list>     \n1 Asia      <tibble [396 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [396]>\n2 Europe    <tibble [360 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [360]>\n3 Africa    <tibble [624 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [624]>\n4 Americas  <tibble [300 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [300]>\n5 Oceania   <tibble [24 × 5]>  <lm>   <dbl [24]> \n\n\nAnd I can then calculate the correlation between the predicted response and the true response, this time using the map2()_dbl function since I want the output the be a numeric vector rather than a list of single elements.\n\n# calculate the correlation between observed and predicted response for each continent\ngapminder_nested <- gapminder_nested %>% \n  mutate(cor = map2_dbl(pred, data, function(.pred, .data) cor(.pred, .data$lifeExp)))\ngapminder_nested\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n# Groups:   continent [5]\n  continent data               lm_obj pred          cor\n  <chr>     <list>             <list> <list>      <dbl>\n1 Asia      <tibble [396 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [396]> 0.723\n2 Europe    <tibble [360 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [360]> 0.834\n3 Africa    <tibble [624 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [624]> 0.645\n4 Americas  <tibble [300 × 5]> <lm>   <dbl [300]> 0.779\n5 Oceania   <tibble [24 × 5]>  <lm>   <dbl [24]>  0.987\n\n\nHoly guacamole, that is so awesome!"

    "section": "When ANOVA is used and who uses it?",
    "text": "When ANOVA is used and who uses it?\nANOVA is used far and wide by the scientific community and beyond. Unfortunately, scientists also frequently misuse ANOVA. A study by Wu et al. (2011) showed that from a survey of 10 leading Chinese medical journals in 2008, 446 articles used ANOVA, and of those articles, 59% of them used ANOVA incorrectly.\nIn this post, I will describe the general framework for ANOVA, the assumptions it requires, and many common pitfalls. While I will introduce a few equations, I will not provide extensive details or derivations. Instead, I will focus on developing intuition for why these equations make sense for the type of problem at hand.\nLet’s start by getting an idea of what kind of questions one can answer using ANOVA. Three examples are presented below.\n\nIs there a difference between the average number of times articles are shared on social media based on day of the week?\nIs there a difference in average waiting room times for a set of 3 different hospitals?\nDoes the presence of other people have an influence on the amount of time taken for a person to help someone in distress?\n\nThe third question is not like the others; can you see why? The first two questions are asking about a difference between mean values of some outcome (article shares or waiting room time) across multiple groups (day of week or hospital). The last question, however, does not seem to satisfy this criteria: while it has a clear outcome (amount of time taken for a person to help someone in distress), it has no obvious groupings.\nDarley and Latané (1969) used ANOVA to answer the question of whether the presence of other people had an influence on the amount of time taken for a person to help someone in distress by setting up an appropriate experiment. In doing so, they were the first to demonstrate the “bystander effect”.\nIn their experiment, the experimenter had the subject wait in a room with either 0, 2, or 4 other individuals. The experimenter announces that the study will begin shortly and walks into an adjacent room. In a few moments the people in the waiting room hear her fall and cry out. The outcome variable is the number of seconds it takes the subject to help the experimenter, and the grouping variable is the number of other people in the room (0, 2, or 4).\nGiven these examples, the definition of ANOVA provided in the following paragraph shouldn’t come as much of a surprise."

    "section": "ANOVA in a nutshell",
    "text": "ANOVA in a nutshell\nANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA), is a widely used method designed for comparing differences in means among three or more groups.\nFor example, we might be interested in comparing the average waiting times in the emergency rooms of three different hospitals. Or perhaps we have conducted a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of five different drugs for reducing blood pressure.\nThe key is that each individual falls into a group described by a (categorical) grouping variable (e.g. hospital or drug group) and for each individual we measure some continuous outcome (e.g. waiting time or blood pressure).\nAlthough there are multiple types of ANOVA, the simplest (“one-way” ANOVA) can be thought of as a generalization of a two-sample t-test. One-way ANOVA involves testing the omnibus hypothesis that k population means are identical:\n\\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = ... = \\mu_k.\\]\nNote that the two-sample t-test tested the hypothesis that two population means are equal (i.e. k = 2).\nThe alternative hypothesis for ANOVA states that any one of the population mean equalities does not hold:\n\\[H_1: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j~~ \\text{ for some } ~~i \\neq j.\\]\nIt is important to note that a rejection of the null hypothesis does not tell you which of the population means differ. It only tells you that there is some population whose mean is different from at least one other population (it could be that all of the means are different from one another!)\n\nA simple toy example: hospital waiting times\nSuppose that we have three hospitals, let’s call them A, B and C (creative names, I know). We are interested in whether all three hospitals have the same the average waiting time for the emergency room.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree hospitals: A, B and C.\n\n\n\n\nWe measured the waiting time for 20 unique individuals at each of these three hospitals (so there are 60 individuals in total). These waiting times (in hours) are recorded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital A\nHospital B\nHospital C\n\n\n\n\n1.8\n0.9\n1.4\n\n\n1.4\n0.7\n2.1\n\n\n0.7\n2.6\n1.4\n\n\n0.8\n1.7\n1.2\n\n\n0.5\n2.5\n2.1\n\n\n2.1\n2.4\n2.3\n\n\n0.9\n2.4\n1.7\n\n\n2.2\n2.3\n1.2\n\n\n1.2\n2.0\n1.1\n\n\n1.3\n1.7\n1.3\n\n\n1.1\n2.1\n0.3\n\n\n1.1\n0.9\n1.7\n\n\n0.4\n2.7\n1.5\n\n\n1.4\n1.5\n1.7\n\n\n0.8\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n1.1\n1.9\n0.8\n\n\n0.6\n2.6\n2.0\n\n\n1.1\n2.4\n2.4\n\n\n1.6\n1.5\n2.2\n\n\n0.9\n1.7\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs pictures tend to be more informative than tables, we present a plot of these waiting times below. To aid the visualization, the x-position of each point is jittered to gently increase the space between the points.\nMost people seem to wait over an hour, with some unlucky individuals waiting for almost 3 hours. The mean waiting time for each hospital is highlighted by a red bar.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question of interest is whether or not the average waiting time for each of the three hospitals is the same. This question might be naively interpreted as: “are the red bars at the same height?”, i.e. is there a difference between the waiting times for the sample of 20 patients from each hospital. The intended question is actually asking about equality between the average waiting times from the population of all patients who have ever, and will ever, wait in these waiting rooms, regardless of whether they fall in our sample.\nAlthough the sample means clearly aren’t identical (the red bars are all at different heights), do we have enough evidence to show that the underlying population waiting time means are different, or are the differences that we observe are simply reflection of the inherent noise in the data?\nThis is the question that lies at the heart of hypothesis testing.\n\n\nWhy is ANOVA called “Analysis of Variance”?\nWhat does comparing means have to do with variability?\nQuite a lot it turns out… simply by asking “are the means different”, we are essentially asking a question about whether the variance of the means is large. However, the variability that we observe between the means themselves only makes sense relative to the overall variance in the data. For example, if the individual observations themselves are extremely variable, then it might be reasonable to expect that the observed group-specific averages might exhibit some variance (even if the underlying true averages are identical).\nThere are two types of variance at play here:\n\nwithin-group variability: the variance of the individual observations within a group, and\nbetween-group variability: the variance between the averages of the groups.\n\nIn the figure below, the red bars in the left panel highlight the within-group variance, while the red bars in the right panel highlight the between-group variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea is that if the variability between the groups is greater than the variability within the groups, then we have evidence that the differences between the groups is not simply reflecting random noise.\nQuantifying the within and between group variability is typically done by calculating a mean sum of squares: add up the squared vertical distances and divide by the degrees of freedom.\nThis means that we are comparing the\n\nbetween sum of squares (BSS): the squared distances from the group means (average over all individuals separately for each hospital) to the global mean (average over all individuals),\n\nto the\n\nwithin sum of squares (WSS): the squared distances from each individual to their group mean (average over all individuals within the same hospital).\n\nUsing this idea we can formulate a test statistic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo spell it out mathematically, we can write these expressions as follows:\n\\[WSS =\\sum_{i = 1}^K \\sum_{j = 1}^{n_i} (y_{ij} - \\overline{y}_{i\\cdot})^2 ~~~~~ \\text{ and } ~~~~~ BSS = \\sum_{i=1}^K (\\overline{y}_{\\cdot \\cdot} - \\overline{y}_{i\\cdot})^2\\]\nwhere \\(y_{ij}\\), defines the waiting room time (outcome) for patient \\(j\\) from hospital \\(i\\), \\(\\overline{y}_{\\cdot \\cdot}\\) defines the global average waiting time and \\(\\overline{y}_{i \\cdot}\\) defines the average waiting time for hospital \\(i\\). \\(K\\) is the number of hospitals, and \\(n_i\\) is the number of patients sampled from hospital \\(i\\).\nNote that in the test statistic above, each quantity is scaled by its degrees of freedom, which when comparing the groups is the number of groups minus 1 (\\(K-1\\)), and when comparing individuals is the number of individuals minus the number of groups (\\(N-K\\))."

    "section": "Working through our waiting times example",
    "text": "Working through our waiting times example\nLet’s examine these assumptions for our Hospital waiting times example.\nUnfortunately, independence is hard to judge statistically, but if, for example, each person was randomly selected from a splattering of visitors to the waiting room at different times (rather than, e.g. selecting 5 members of the same family all of whom came to the hospital together in some freak accident), then the assumption of independence is probably ok.\nThe figure below plots the density estimation for the waiting times from each hospital. We know that if our data is normally distributed, it should look vaguely like a bell-curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne might argue that these are some pretty funky-looking bell-curves…\nHowever, as I was the one who simulated this data in the first place, I can assure you that they are in fact normally distributed, and you can use this as a lesson on the difficult of drawing conclusions on normality from small samples (in this case, we have 20 observations in each group).\nA Shapiro-Wilk test for normality provides p-values of 0.39, 0.087, 0.52 for hospitals A, B and C, respectively. Although none of these values are “significant” (even unadjusted for multiple testing), we have stumbled upon another lesson: small p-values (\\(p = 0.087\\) for hospital B) can certainly occur when the null hypothesis is true (in this case, the null hypothesis is that the data are normally distributed)! Remember that when the null hypothesis is true, p-values are uniformly distributed.\nFinally, based on a visual assessment, the common variance assumption is probably fairly reasonable (and, again, since I simulated this data, I can confirm that the variance is the same for each hospital).\nTo test this formally, Bartlett’s test for homogeneity of variances yields a p-value of 0.68, indicating that we do not have evidence that the variances are different.\nWe have now concluded that the assumptions for ANOVA are satisfied, and can proceed to do our calculations.\nCalculating the between-sum-of-squares (BSS) and scaling by the degrees of freedom (the number of groups minus 1), and the within-sum-of-squares (WSS) and scaling by the degrees of freedom (the number of observations minus the number of groups), we get that\n\\[\\frac{BSS}{K - 1} = \\frac{5.94}{3 - 1} = 2.97 ~~~~~~ \\text{and} ~~~~~ \\frac{WSS}{N - K} = \\frac{16.96}{60 - 3} = 0.30.\\]\nOur test statistic turns out to be quite large indeed:\n\\[F = \\frac{BSS/(K-1)}{WSS/(N-k)} = \\frac{2.97}{0.3} = 9.98.\\]\nSince we are confident that the ANOVA assumptions are satisfied, this F-statistic must follow an F distribution with suitable degrees of freedom. Our p-value can thus be calculated as follows:\n\\[P(F_{2, 53} \\geq 9.98) = 0.000192\\]\nAnd we can claim to have evidence that the three group means are not all identical. Note that we can interpret this as the distances between the group means and the global mean is quite large relative to the distances between the individual observations and the group means. Recall that these distances are scaled by their respective degrees of freedom.\nRather than conducting these calculations by hand, in R, one could simply use the aov() function:\n\nsummary(aov(time ~ hospital, data = data))\n\n\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    \nvariable     2  5.938  2.9688   9.981 0.000192 ***\nResiduals   57 16.955  0.2975                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nobtaining the same p-value.\n\nANOVA as a linear model\nSo far we have discussed ANOVA purely as a hypothesis test comparing two different types of variability. It is, however, more common to talk about ANOVA as a linear model.\nThe anova linear model can be written as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu\\) represents the overall average wait time across all hospitals, and \\(\\tau_i\\) represents the amount of time that is either added or subtracted from the overall average as a result of being at hospital \\(i\\). To get the average wait time for hospital \\(i\\) we can calculate \\(\\mu_i := \\mu + \\tau_i\\).\nFinally, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) represents the “noise” term; the quantity that defines how the waiting time for individual \\(j\\) differs from the mean (within their group).\nWe typically assume that the expected value (the average over the population) for \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is equal to zero, and that the \\(\\tau_i\\)s add up to zero. Note that if we do not assume that \\(\\tau_i\\)s sum to zero, then the model is “over-parametrized” in that there would be an infinite number of ways to define the \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau_i\\)s such that they add up to the group mean \\(\\mu_i\\).\nThe question that is sure to be on the edge of your tongue is “how is this possibly equivalent to the hypothesis test discussed above?”\nThe answer is simple and can be summarized by the diagram below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, if the hospital-specific effects \\(\\tau_A, \\tau_B,\\) and \\(\\tau_C\\) are all equal to zero, then the average effect across all groups is the same: \\(\\mu_A = \\mu_B = \\mu_C = \\mu\\)."

    "text": "Common pitfalls of ANOVA and alternative approaches\nDespite its perceived simplicity, scientists frequently misuse ANOVA. A study by Wu et al. (2011) showed that from a survey of 10 leading Chinese medical journals in 2008, 446 articles used ANOVA, and of those articles, 59% of them used ANOVA incorrectly.\nBelow we will discuss many of the common pitfalls.\n\nUsing one-way ANOVA when there is more than one grouping variable\nSuppose that instead of solely measuring waiting times from emergency waiting rooms at each hospital, we instead measured the waiting times from three medical departments from each hospital: surgery, pediatrics, and dentistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this scenario we should adapt the model to take the second grouping variable into account. This is called two-way ANOVA, and the model can be adapted as follows:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\gamma_j + \\beta_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau_i\\) represents the hospital-specific effect on waiting time and \\(\\gamma_j\\) represents the department-specific effect. \\(\\beta_{ij}\\) represents an interaction term between these two effects.\nAnother adaptation of ANOVA when the second grouping variable (medical department) is not the same across each hospital is called nested ANOVA (see fig below). For example, perhaps we are comparing both hospitals and medical departments, but we are not examining the same medical department in each hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConducting ANOVA multiple times for multiple outcomes\nSuppose that instead of simply being interested in whether there is a difference between waiting time for each hospital, we were also interested in differences in average length of hospital stay and cost of visit. Then the incorrect way to proceed would be to generate three separate ANOVA models and draw our conclusions separately for each model. This reeks of multiple testing issues and does not take into account any dependence between the different outcome variables.\nInstead, one should use Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), which can be written as follows:\n\\[ \\left[\\begin{array}a  y_{ij1} \\\\ y_{ij2} \\\\ y_{ij3} \\end{array} \\right]= \\mu + \\tau_i +  \\epsilon_{ij}\\] where\n\n\\(y_{ij1}\\) is the waiting time for individual \\(j\\) from hospital \\(i\\),\n\\(y_{ij2}\\) is the length of hospital stay for individual \\(j\\) from hospital \\(i\\), and\n\\(y_{ij3}\\) is the cost of the visit for individual \\(j\\) from hospital \\(i\\).\n\n\n\nIncorrectly conducting multiple pair-wise comparisons following ANOVA\nUpon obtaining a “significant” ANOVA p-value, a common mistake is to then go and test all of the pairwise differences to identify which of the populations had different means. This is another example of multiple hypothesis testing, and corrections on these p-values must be made. See the Wikipedia page for details on this common issue.\n\n\nUsing ANOVA to analyse repeated-measures data\nWhat if, instead of having measured the waiting room times on a different set of 20 people at each hospital (left-panel in fig below), we instead measured the waiting room times on the same set of 20 people at each hospital (right-panel in fig below)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have certainly violated the assumption that our observations are independent. Fortunately, repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) is a method for exactly this situation.\nBasically, rANOVA simply splits the within sum of squares into the individual-level sum of squares and the random error sum of squares. An excellent article describing rANOVA can be found here. A common repeated measures experimental design involves observations being made at different time points (as opposed to at different hospitals).\nAccording to the Wikipedia article,\n\nrANOVA is not always the best statistical analysis for repeated measure designs. The rANOVA is vulnerable to effects from missing values, imputation, unequivalent time points between subjects and violations of sphericity. These issues can result in sampling bias and inflated rates of Type I error. In such cases it may be better to consider use of a linear mixed model."

    "text": "Freqently asked questions\n\nCan I use ANOVA if my data violates the assumption of common variances?\nAccording to this post on Stats Stack Exchange, if the sample size in each group is similar, and the difference between variance isn’t too bad, you should be ok.\nAccording to user gung, with similar group sizes there is a rule of thumb that states that\n\nANOVA is robust to heterogeneity of variance so long as the largest variance is not more than 4 times the smallest variance.\n\nI’ll admit that I haven’t checked this claim, but I’d be willing to believe it.\nIf, however, your data has wildly different group variances or varying group sizes, then I’m not entirely sure of what options exist (note that the non-parametric alternative also assumes that the population variances are similar).\n\n\nIf my data are not normal, can I simply transform it and draw the conclusions as normal?\nYes, probably.\n\n\nHow does the ANOVA for model comparison work?\nIt is common to use the anova() function in R to compare two different models. Specifically, it compares nested models wherein one model consists of a subset of the set of variables of the other model.\nNote that the use of the word “nested” here has nothing to do with the nested anova discussed above in which the grouping variables themselves (rather than the models) were nested.\nThe comparison being made by ANOVA in this situation is whether the residual sum of squares (which is essentially the within sum of squares from one-way ANOVA) for model 1 (the larger model) is larger than the residual sum of squares for model 2 (the smaller model).\nSpecifically, it calculates the F-statistic\n\\[F = \\frac{(RSS_{\\text{model 2}} - RSS_{\\text{model 1}})/(p_1 - p_2)}{RSS_{\\text{model 1}}/(n - p_1)}\\]\nThe idea is that since model 2 is a special case of model 1, model 1 is more complex so \\(RSS_{\\text{model 2}}\\) will always be as least as large as \\(RSS_{\\text{model 1}}\\). The question is whether the difference is “statistically significant”.\nNote that if you call the anova() function with a single model, it will compare the first variable in the model to a baseline model with no predictors. If there is a second variable, it compares the model with both variables against the model with just one variable, and so on and so forth.\nSee this set of slides by James Steiger if you’re interested in further details."

    "text": "Reproducbility workflow\nEvery project should consist of a single well structured directory with meaningful subdirectories. Every project should be its own git repository that is hosted on GitHub.\nData cleaning and analyses should be carefully documented in a Jupyter Notebook or R markdown file and should be created with reproducibility in mind. Everyone on the team (and future you) should be able to re-create what you have performed.\nThe overall purpose is to have an organized project structure in place so that the project is easily approachable to many different individuals.\n\nSomeone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your computer files and understand in detail what you did and why - Bill Noble\n\nAn example of a reproducible project that follows this workflow lives in the project_example/ folder.\n\nProject Structure\nThe project will typically consist of the following subdirectories:\n\nData\nOriginal raw data files data should be backed up on something like Google Drive, Dropbox or Box. The raw data itself should never be touched manually. Instead, you should have scripts or notebooks that load the raw data into an R or Python environment for in-environment data manipulation (this will not modify the raw data files themselves).\nAny data that is produced by code should be saved in the data/processed_data/ subdirectory.\n\n\nDocuments\nThis is a good place to keep meeting notes, data dictionaries, and any other associated materials.\n\n\nCode\nThere are three types of code documents:\n\nFunction scripts (.R, .py): scripts that contain reusable functions that will be called in the action scripts below (and possibly in the exploration notebooks). By convention, function scripts are given the name xx_funs_yy.R, where xx is a number and yy describes what the functions are for (e.g. 01_funs_clean_data.R).\nAction scripts (.R, .py): scripts that perform activities such as a detailed data cleaning pipeline, or running many models. Often these scripts will load in data, do something to it (e.g. clean it or fit a model to it) and will then save a new object (such as a cleaned dataset or model results). By convention, action scripts are given the name xx_do_yy.R, where xx is a number and yy describes what action is undertaken by running the script (e.g. 01_do_clean_data.R).\nExploration notebooks (.Rmd, .ipynb): R Markdown or Jupyter notebook files that are used to produce figures and explanatory files that contain figures and explanations of data cleaning steps and results of analyses. These are the files that an external viewer would find useful to understand your data and analysis.\n\nScripts that are run sequentially are numbered accordingly. An example of a project structure is shown below. Note that in the example below the functions folder is nested as a subdirectory of the scripts folder which contains the actionable scripts. This makes sense when the functions are only called in the actionable scripts (but not in the exploration notebooks).\nproject\n│   README.md\n└───data/\n│       └───raw_data/\n│           │   data_orig.csv\n│       └───processed_data/\n│           │   data_clean.csv\n│       └───results/\n│           │   model_results.csv\n└───documents/\n│       meeting_notes.md\n│       data_dictionary.md\n└───code/\n│       └───exploration/\n│           │   01_data_exploration.Rmd\n│           │   02_model_results.Rmd\n│       └───scripts/\n│           │   01_do_clean_data.R\n│           │   02_do_model_data.R\n│           └───functions/\n│               │   01_funs_clean_data.R\n│               │   02_funs_model_data.R\n\n\n\n\nSyntax and conventions\nAll filenames are always lowercase and use underscores to separate words.\nCode should follow an appropriate style guide:\n\nR: Tidyverse Style Guide (based on the R Google Style Guide)\nPython: Google Style Guide\n\n\n\nResources\n\nI wrote a much more detailed blog post on my workflow a few years ago that can be found here: http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-08-16-data-science-workflow/.

    "title": "5 useful R tips from rstudio::conf(2020) - tidy eval, piping, conflicts, bar charts and colors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This was my second year attending rstudio::conf() as a diversity scholar (and my first time as a speaker), and I was yet again blown away by the friendliness of the community and the quality of the talks. Over the course of the week, I met so many wonderful and talented humans, and learnt so many incredibly useful things. This post is all about the little tips and tricks that I picked up from watching many fantastic presentations, attendees live tweeting, and having many insightful conversations.\n\nTip 1: Tidy evaluation\nTidy eval is one of those terms that seems to float around a lot in the R community, but I feel like 99% of us don’t really get what tidy eval is, nor why we should care about it. Turns out, unless we’re getting deep into package development, we probably don’t need to be up to speed with tidy eval. The only part of tidy eval that I know is this: how to supply column names as unquoted arguments in functions. All of the resources I found on tidy eval go into waaay more detail about how it works, and maybe one day I’ll care about that, but that time is not now.\nFor this (and the next few) example, I’ll use the midwest dataset from the ggplot2 package, the first 6 rows of which are shown below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nhead(midwest)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 28\n    PID county    state  area poptotal popdens…¹ popwh…² popbl…³ popam…⁴ popas…⁵\n  <int> <chr>     <chr> <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>\n1   561 ADAMS     IL    0.052    66090     1271.   63917    1702      98     249\n2   562 ALEXANDER IL    0.014    10626      759     7054    3496      19      48\n3   563 BOND      IL    0.022    14991      681.   14477     429      35      16\n4   564 BOONE     IL    0.017    30806     1812.   29344     127      46     150\n5   565 BROWN     IL    0.018     5836      324.    5264     547      14       5\n6   566 BUREAU    IL    0.05     35688      714.   35157      50      65     195\n# … with 18 more variables: popother <int>, percwhite <dbl>, percblack <dbl>,\n#   percamerindan <dbl>, percasian <dbl>, percother <dbl>, popadults <int>,\n#   perchsd <dbl>, percollege <dbl>, percprof <dbl>, poppovertyknown <int>,\n#   percpovertyknown <dbl>, percbelowpoverty <dbl>, percchildbelowpovert <dbl>,\n#   percadultpoverty <dbl>, percelderlypoverty <dbl>, inmetro <int>,\n#   category <chr>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​popdensity, ²​popwhite,\n#   ³​popblack, ⁴​popamerindian, ⁵​popasian\n\n\nSuppose that you want to write a function that plays nicely with the tidyverse (e.g. can take unquoted column names just like tidyverse functions do). Such an example might be one that makes a plot where the user supplies the variables:\n\nplotMidwest <- function(var1, var2) {\n  ggplot(midwest) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = var1, y = var2))\n}\n\nTheoretically, this plot should be able to take the arguments popdensity and percbelowpoverty and provide me with a scatterplot of these two columns against one another:\n\nplotMidwest(popdensity, percbelowpoverty)\n\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! Problem while computing aesthetics.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error in `FUN()`:\n! object 'popdensity' not found\n\n\nbut this doesn’t work! Perhaps if I quote the variable names it will work:\n\nplotMidwest(\"popdensity\", \"percbelowpoverty\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code didn’t throw an error, but this is literally plotting the word “popdensity” against the word “percbelowpoverty”, which isn’t what I wanted to do!\nThe secret to providing column names as arguments to a function is…. tidy eval! Fortunately even without understanding why it works (something about delaying evaluation until later in the execution path blah blah blah), you can use tidy eval. The way you do this is to envelop your arguments within the function in curly braces {{ }}:\n\nplotMidwestTidy <- function(var1, var2) {\n  ggplot(midwest) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = {{ var1 }}, y = {{ var2 }}))\n}\n\nNow when I provide my column names as unquoted variables, I actually get the scatterplot I wanted!\n\nplotMidwestTidy(popdensity, percbelowpoverty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that my tidy eval version of my plotMidwest() function isn’t designed to take quoted variable names. The following code yields the same plot as before of the word “popdensity” against the word “percbelowpoverty”.\n\nplotMidwestTidy(\"popdensity\", \"percbelowpoverty\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA neat little trick I learned from Dewey Dunnington’s talk is that you can use .data as placeholder for the data object inside aes(). This means that, if var is a character column name, you can access the quoted column from the data object using .data[[var]]:\n\nplotMidwestQuoted <- function(var1, var2) {\n  ggplot(midwest) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = .data[[var1]], y = .data[[var2]]))\n}\nplotMidwestQuoted(\"popdensity\", \"percbelowpoverty\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDewey’s talk is full of gems (check out his slides: https://fishandwhistle.net/slides/rstudioconf2020/#1).\n\n\nTip 2: Pipe into later arguments of a function using .\nWhile I didn’t technically learn this one from a talk at rstudio::conf(2020), I did run into an old friend Garth Tarr who told me about this piping trick: if you want to pipe an object into any argument other than the first one, you can do so using the . placeholder. For instance, let’s say that you want to use the lm() function to fit a linear model, and because you, like me, are pipe-obsessed, you want to pipe the data into lm().\nSadly, when I try to pipe the midwest data into my lm() function for regressing population density (popdensity) against poverty rate (percbelowpoverty), I get an error.\n\nmidwest %>%\n  lm(popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty)\n\nError in as.data.frame.default(data): cannot coerce class '\"formula\"' to a data.frame\n\n\nWhat’s going wrong? There are two things you need to understand about what’s happening here:\n\nThe argument order of lm() is: lm(formula, data), i.e. the data is the second argument of the lm function (whereas all tidyverse functions have the data as the first argument)\nThe pipe, %>%, automatically places the object to the left of the pipe into the first argument of the function to the right of the pipe\n\nso midwest %>% lm(popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty) above is equivalent to lm(formula = iris, data = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width), which has the arguments reversed.\nInstead of abandoning the trusty pipe (the thought of which fills me with sadness), I can instead pipe the data into the second argument using . as a placeholder for the position into which I want to pipe the data:\n\nmidwest %>% lm(popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty, .)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty, data = .)\n\nCoefficients:\n     (Intercept)  percbelowpoverty  \n         4068.06            -77.56  \n\n\nNote that I could alternatively name the formula argument, which would automatically pipe the object into the first unassigned argument (which in our case is the data argument), but this becomes cumbersome when you have many arguments.\n\nmidwest %>% lm(formula = popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = popdensity ~ percbelowpoverty, data = .)\n\nCoefficients:\n     (Intercept)  percbelowpoverty  \n         4068.06            -77.56  \n\n\n\n\nTip 3: Function conflicts workaround (no more dplyr::select())\nHave you ever loaded the MASS R package and found that select() from dplyr no longer works? I regularly get this type of error when functions from different packages have the same name as tidyverse functions I use on the reg. Let’s pretend that I really want to select the cut variable from the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package.\nThe first 6 rows of the diamonds dataset are shown below:\n\nhead(diamonds)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n  <dbl> <ord>     <ord> <ord>   <dbl> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  0.23 Ideal     E     SI2      61.5    55   326  3.95  3.98  2.43\n2  0.21 Premium   E     SI1      59.8    61   326  3.89  3.84  2.31\n3  0.23 Good      E     VS1      56.9    65   327  4.05  4.07  2.31\n4  0.29 Premium   I     VS2      62.4    58   334  4.2   4.23  2.63\n5  0.31 Good      J     SI2      63.3    58   335  4.34  4.35  2.75\n6  0.24 Very Good J     VVS2     62.8    57   336  3.94  3.96  2.48\n\n\nSadly if I loaded the MASS library before trying to select cut from diamonds, I get the following error:\n\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\ndiamonds %>% select(cut)\n\nError in select(., cut): unused argument (cut)\n\n\nThis is because by loading MASS, I have overwritten dplyr’s select() function (hence the warning). The normal workaround is to be explicit about what select() function you want using dplyr::select() as in\n\ndiamonds %>% dplyr::select(cut)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 1\n   cut      \n   <ord>    \n 1 Ideal    \n 2 Premium  \n 3 Good     \n 4 Premium  \n 5 Good     \n 6 Very Good\n 7 Very Good\n 8 Very Good\n 9 Fair     \n10 Very Good\n# … with 53,930 more rows\n\n\nBut this can be really annoying if you have a lot of select()s in your code (because you have to go through and apply dplyr:: to each one). It turns out (as tweeted by Birunda Chelliah - I’m not where she learned it though) that a better workaround is to set conflict hierarchies at the top of your document (conflict_prefer(\"select\", \"dplyr\")) to specify that the select() function should always come from the dplyr package.\n\n# install.packages(\"conflicted\")\nlibrary(conflicted)\n# set conflict preference\nconflict_prefer(\"select\", \"dplyr\")\n\n[conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::select over any other package.\n\n\nNow when I use select() it works just fine!\n\n# no more error!\ndiamonds %>% select(cut)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 1\n   cut      \n   <ord>    \n 1 Ideal    \n 2 Premium  \n 3 Good     \n 4 Premium  \n 5 Good     \n 6 Very Good\n 7 Very Good\n 8 Very Good\n 9 Fair     \n10 Very Good\n# … with 53,930 more rows\n\n\n\n\nTip 4: geom_col(): you’ll never have to specify “stat = identity” for your bar plots ever again!\nMost of the time when I want to make a bar chart, I want to provide an x variable for the bar categories, and a y variable for the height of the bar for each category. Sadly, this isn’t what geom_bar() does by default - its default behaviour is to count each level of the provided x aesthetic. For instance, in the diamonds dataset, the cut variable takes 5 unique values: fair, good, very good, premium and ideal. Providing cut as the x-aesthetic for geom_bar() will, by default, count the number of times each of these unique values appear in the data and use these counts as the heights.\nThe default usage of geom_bar() is as follows\n\ndiamonds %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich automatically counts the number of time each cut appears in the data.\nHowever (putting aside arguments about what types of data bar charts are appropriate for), I frequently want to use a bar chart to display something other than a count. For instance, the average price of each cut, shown below.\n\naverage_price <- diamonds %>% \n  group_by(cut) %>%\n  summarise(average_price = mean(price)) %>%\n  ungroup() \naverage_price\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  cut       average_price\n  <ord>             <dbl>\n1 Fair              4359.\n2 Good              3929.\n3 Very Good         3982.\n4 Premium           4584.\n5 Ideal             3458.\n\n\nIf I try to set the y aesthetic of geom_bar to y = average_price, I get an annoying error:\n\naverage_price %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = average_price))\n\nError in `geom_bar()`:\n! Problem while computing stat.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error in `setup_params()`:\n! `stat_count()` must only have an x or y aesthetic.\n\n\nThe typical fix for this is to include stat = 'identity' as an argument of geom_bar().\n\naverage_price %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = average_price), stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it turns out there’s a better way!\nDuring his fantastic talk on his ggtext package, Claus Wilke) casually used the geom_col() function to create a column chart (is that what geom_col() stands for?), which, as it turns out, is what I’ve been trying to make the whole time:\n\naverage_price %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = cut, y = average_price))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis probably wasn’t what Claus imagined me to take away from his talk, but I swear ggtext was super cool too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 5: Using show_col() for viewing colour palettes\nLast but not least, Dana Paige Seidel gave a great talk on the scales package, which does a lot of great things under the hood of ggplot. But scales also let’s you look at colours! The show_col() function shows you what colours look like:\n\nlibrary(scales)\nshow_col(c(\"#9C89B8\", \"#F0A6CA\", \"#EFC3E6\", \"#F0E6EF\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso a quick plug for how I chose these colours (and how I choose colours in general): https://coolors.co/app.\nI’m super excited for rstudio::conf(2021)!!"

    "text": "Developing a seamless, clean workflow for data analysis is harder than it sounds, especially because this is something that is almost never explicitly taught. Apparently we are all just supposed to “figure it out for ourselves”. For most of us, when we start our first few analysis projects, we basically have no idea how we are going to structure all of our files, or even what files we will need to make. As we try more and more things in our analysis (perhaps generating a large number of unnecessary files called analysis2.R, next-analysis.R, analysis-writeup.Rmd, data_clean.csv, regression_results.csv and data_all.csv along the way), we find that our project folder gets jumbled and confusing. The frustration when we come back to the project 6 months later and can’t remember which file contained the code that lead to the final conclusions is all too real.\nThis is why I have decided to describe in (possibly too much) detail the data cleaning workflow that I have somehow ended up with. I find this workflow to be particularly useful when dealing with messy (and possibly large) datasets that need several cleaning steps. Note that I did not develop this workflow in conjunction with any resources, I simply figured out what worked best for me via trial-and-error (a process which took 5 years and is definitely still ongoing). There will be several other resources out there on the internet describing “optimal workflows”, and these are definitely worth a read too (although a quick google found surprisingly few with the level of detail needed for a beginner). The key is figuring out a workflow that works best for you. That may be similar to mine, or it may not be.\nIf you decide to keep reading (perhaps because you too suffer from messy-project-syndrome and want some relief), by the end of this post you will know far too much about me and how I spend my time. As you will discover, I am particularly thorough when I clean data, and can spend hours simply making sure that I know what is in the data and moulding it so that it exactly adheres precisely to the format that I consider “clean”.\nIn this post I will describe my thought process as I download, clean and prepare for analysis the data from the 2016 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). I have written my process in sufficient detail such that you can follow along if you’d like to.\nThe American Time Use Survey is a yearly survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As with all surveys, it is probably good practice to first get an idea of what kind of population its respondents are supposed to represent. According to their website, the survey is sent to a randomly selected individual from each household in a set of eligible households chosen so as to represent a range of demographic characteristics. The set of eligible households consist of those who have completed their final month of the Current Population Survey (a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics).\nThis survey data has been featured heavily on Nathan Yau’s blog, Flowing Data, which is where I became aware of it (thanks Nathan!)."

    "text": "The loadData() function\nTo make things simple in the long-run, I turn the above commands into a reusable function called loadData(). This function will have only one argument that specifies the path of the data in the local directory (relative to the load.R file). I usually set the default path to be the actual path for my setup.\n\n# a function to load in the data\nloadData <- function(path_to_data = \"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\") {\n  # open zipped file for reading\n  unz <- gzfile(path_to_data)\n  # load in the data\n  read.csv(unz)\n}\n\nTo test my function, I simply run in my console by typing\n\ntime_use_orig <- loadData()\n\nand look at the output of head(time_use_orig).\nObviously such a function is a bit redundant in this setting: it is just as easy to write read.csv(gzfile(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")) in my eventual eda.Rmd file as it is to write loadData(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\"). The reason I keep the load.R file in this case is because this is just my default workflow. I always load in my data using a function called loadData. In some situations, there are many, many things that need to be done in order to load the data, meaning that my loadData function can be fairly complicated. For example, sometimes column names need to be read in separately and then attached to the data, and sometimes I need to play with the format of the data to get R to play nice."

    "text": "The cleanData() function\nThe cleanData() function will actually call three separate functions, each performing a single task. These functions are\n\nrenameColumns(): an optional part of my workflow that changes the column names of each of my columns so that I can actually understand what they mean.\nconvertMissing(): a function which converts missing values to NA\nconvertClass: a function which sets factor variables to factors, sets character variables to characters, etc\n\n\nMaking columns human-readable: renameColumns()\nI hate reading column names that are all-caps, use ridiculous abbreviations and generally don’t adhere to my definition of “aesthetically pleasing”. Thus, whenever possible, I tend to convert my column names to human-readable versions. This is fairly tedious whenever the data has more than around 10 variables or so, but the process itself of renaming the variables is a very effective way of ensuring that you have a good idea of which variables are even in the data.\nA word of caution: it is extremely important to check that you have correctly renamed the variables, since it is very easy to assign the wrong name to a variable, resulting in misleading conclusions.\nObviously this step is not practical if you have more than 100 or so variables (although I once did it with a dataset that had around 300 variables!). In addition, if I will at some point need to present the data to people who are very familiar with the original variable names, I won’t do any renaming either.\nIn this case, however, I have no particular allegiance to the original variable names and I want to make it as clear as possible (to myself, at least) what they mean.\nTo change the variable names, the renameColumns() function will leverage the dplyr function, select(). Note that I also drop a few variables at this stage that I decided weren’t interesting.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nrenameColumns <- function(data) {\n  data <- data %>% select(id = CASEID,\n                          year = YEAR,\n                          # number of attempted contacts\n                          num_contacts = NUMCONTACTS_CPS8,\n                          state = STATEFIP,\n                          household_size = HH_SIZE,\n                          family_income = FAMINCOME,\n                          num_children = HH_NUMKIDS,\n                          num_adults = HH_NUMADULTS,\n                          age = AGE,\n                          sex = SEX,\n                          race = RACE,\n                          marital_status = MARST,\n                          education_level = EDUC,\n                          education_years = EDUCYRS,\n                          employment_status = EMPSTAT,\n                          occupation_category = OCC2,\n                          occupation_industry = IND2,\n                          employed_full_time = FULLPART,\n                          hours_usually_worked = UHRSWORKT,\n                          weekly_earning = EARNWEEK,\n                          paid_hourly = PAIDHOUR,\n                          hourly_wage = HOURWAGE,\n                          hours_worked_hourly_rate = HRSATRATE,\n                          time_spent_caring_household = ACT_CAREHH,\n                          time_spent_caring_non_household = ACT_CARENHH,\n                          time_spent_education = ACT_EDUC,\n                          time_spent_eating = ACT_FOOD,\n                          time_spent_gov = ACT_GOVSERV,\n                          time_spent_household_activities = ACT_HHACT,\n                          time_spent_household_services = ACT_HHSERV,\n                          time_spent_personal_care = ACT_PCARE,\n                          time_spent_phone = ACT_PHONE,\n                          time_spent_personal_care_services = ACT_PROFSERV,\n                          time_spent_shopping = ACT_PURCH,\n                          time_spent_religion = ACT_RELIG,\n                          time_spent_leisure = ACT_SOCIAL,\n                          time_spent_sports = ACT_SPORTS,\n                          time_spent_travelling = ACT_TRAVEL,\n                          time_spent_volunteer = ACT_VOL,\n                          time_spent_working = ACT_WORK)\n  return(data)\n}\n\nI then test the function out by writing\n\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n\nin the console, and looking at the output of head(time_use).\nNow, I am fully aware that this function I have just written is not generalizable to alternate subsets of the data variables. This will be one of only two places where I will need to change things if I want to re-run the analysis on a different subset of variables (the second place will be when I explicitly convert numeric variables to their character counterparts). I’m facing a trade-off between generalizability of my pipeline and having human-readable data. If I were intending to repeat this analysis on different variables, I would either remove the part of the workflow where I rename the variables (as well as the part where I convert numeric variables to meaningful factors later on), or I would set the variable names as an argument in the renameColumns() function (but sadly, select() doesn’t play very nicely with variables read in as character strings, so I try to avoid this).\n\n\nRecoding missing values as NA: convertMissing()\nIf you took a look at the codebook, you will have noticed that there are many different ways to say that data is missing. This can be very problematic.\nThe most common way to code missingness in this data is to code it as 99 999, 9999, etc (depending on whether the entries for the variable are two, three, four or more digit numbers, respectively). These entries are referred to in the codebook as NIU (Not in universe). Other types of missing values are recorded such as 996 corresponding to Refused, 997 corresponding to Don't know and 998 corresponding to Blank.\nI now need to decide what to convert to NA, keeping in mind that I need to be particularly careful for the variables with many different types of missingness (such as people who refused to answer, didn’t know or simply left the entry blank). I decide to take a look to see how widespread these types of missingness are by running the following code in the console:\n\n# identify how many times informative missingness occurs for each variable\ninformative_missing <- sapply(time_use, \n                              function(x) sum(x %in% c(996, 997, 998)))\n# print out only the non-zero values\ninformative_missing[informative_missing != 0]\n\n          weekly_earning hours_worked_hourly_rate time_spent_personal_care \n                       1                       12                        1 \n      time_spent_leisure       time_spent_working \n                       1                        1 \n\n\nSince these types of missingness are extremely rare, I decide to simply lump them in with all of the other NA values.\nNext, I want to identify which variables have missing values coded as a varying number of 9s. Since the missing values are always supposed to correspond to the maximum, I printed out the maximum of each variable.\n\n# print out the maximum of each column\nsapply(time_use, max)\n\n                               id                              year \n                     2.016121e+13                      2.016000e+03 \n                     num_contacts                             state \n                     8.000000e+00                      5.600000e+01 \n                   household_size                     family_income \n                     1.300000e+01                      1.600000e+01 \n                     num_children                        num_adults \n                     9.000000e+00                      8.000000e+00 \n                              age                               sex \n                     8.500000e+01                      2.000000e+00 \n                             race                    marital_status \n                     4.000000e+02                      6.000000e+00 \n                  education_level                   education_years \n                     4.300000e+01                      3.210000e+02 \n                employment_status               occupation_category \n                     5.000000e+00                      9.999000e+03 \n              occupation_industry                employed_full_time \n                     9.999000e+03                      9.900000e+01 \n             hours_usually_worked                    weekly_earning \n                     9.999000e+03                      9.999999e+04 \n                      paid_hourly                       hourly_wage \n                     9.900000e+01                      9.999900e+02 \n         hours_worked_hourly_rate       time_spent_caring_household \n                     9.990000e+02                      8.800000e+02 \n  time_spent_caring_non_household              time_spent_education \n                     9.100000e+02                      1.000000e+03 \n                time_spent_eating                    time_spent_gov \n                     6.350000e+02                      4.700000e+02 \n  time_spent_household_activities     time_spent_household_services \n                     1.184000e+03                      4.500000e+02 \n         time_spent_personal_care                  time_spent_phone \n                     1.434000e+03                      4.200000e+02 \ntime_spent_personal_care_services               time_spent_shopping \n                     5.250000e+02                      6.000000e+02 \n              time_spent_religion                time_spent_leisure \n                     7.130000e+02                      1.392000e+03 \n                time_spent_sports             time_spent_travelling \n                     1.260000e+03                      1.265000e+03 \n             time_spent_volunteer                time_spent_working \n                     9.200000e+02                      1.350000e+03 \n\n\nI notice here that there are several variables with missing values as their maxima such as occupation_industry with a maximum of 9999, and hourly_wage with a maximum of 999.99. Since I don’t really want to manually convert these missing values to NA, I decide to automate it using the mutate_if() function from the dplyr package. First I write a few helper functions in the clean.R file for calculating the maximum of a vector and for identifying specific values in a vector.\n\n# Helper function for identifying missing values equal to 99, 999, etc\nequalFun <- function(x, value) {\n  x == value\n}\n\n# Helper function for identifying if the max of a variable is equal to 99, ...\nmaxFun <- function(x, value) {\n  max(x, na.rm = T) == value\n}\n\nThe first argument of mutate_if() is a function which returns a Boolean value specifying which columns to select. The second argument is wrapped in funs() and itself is a function which specifies what to do to each column. if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .) can be read aloud as “If the value is equal to 99, convert it to a NA of integer type, otherwise do nothing” (the . serves as a placeholder for the data, like x in function(x)).\n\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .)))\n  return(data)    \n}\n\nIt took some playing around with running the body of the function in the console (with data defined as time_use) to get it to run without errors (I was getting errors to do with NA values and realized that I needed to add na.rm = T in the maxFun() function).\nOnce the body runs in the console, I then check to make sure that the complete function worked as expected by running it in the console and checking out the summary of the output.\n\n# convert the missing values to NAs\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please

peculiarities. In particular, there are several variables that have stupidly large values. For example the maximum value for hours_usually_worked is 9995 (this didn’t appear in the codebook!). I decided to look at a histogram of this variable to see how typical this value is. I ran the following code in the console:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4119 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the histogram, it is fairly clear that there is an additional type of missing value (405 samples have a value of 9995) that was not mentioned in the documentation. I then go back and update my convertMissing() function to include this extra missing value.\n\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9995 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9995), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9995), NA_integer_, .))) \n  return(data)    \n}\n\nNext, I ran the convertMissing() function again the data and re-made the histogram to make sure that everything was going smoothly.\n\n# re-run the renameColumns() function\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n# convert missing values to NA\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# re-make the histogram\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4524 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that that was sorted out, it occurred to me that I wasn’t sure what kind of scale the time_spent variables were on (is it hours spent in the last week? In the last month? The last year? Perhaps it is minutes spent over the last day? It probably should have occurred to me to ask this earlier, but it didn’t. Whatever… I’m asking it now! After spending some time perusing the internet for a while, I found this table which summarised the average hours spend per day on a range of activities. For example, it said that on average, people spend 9.58 hours per day on “personal care activities”. The histogram below shows the distribution of values for the time_spent_personal_care.\n\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = time_spent_personal_care))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean value in the data is 580, which when divided by 60 gives 9.6. From this “evidence” I conclude that what the data contains is the number of minutes spent per day. Whether this is averaged over a week, or is based on one particular day, I honestly don’t know. But for my purposes, I’ll just take each value as the number of minutes spent on the activity on a “typical” day.\n\n\nEnsuring each variable has the correct class: convertClass()\nThe final cleaning task involves converting categorical values to have a categorical variable class (such as a factor), and other things along these lines involving variable classes.\nRecall that the person ID variable, CASEID, is currently coded as a numeric (which is printed in scientific notation). In general, it is good practice to code IDs as factors (or characters).\nThere are also many other variables that should be coded as factors: state, sex, race, marital_status, education_level, family_income, employment_status, occupation_category, and occupation_industry.\nNow begins the part of my cleaning process that often takes the longest: I am going to convert each of these numeric variables not only to factors, but to meaningful factors. I don’t want to make plots for genders 1 and 2, or for states 42 and 28; I want to make plots for males and females and for states Pennsylvania and Mississippi.\nFirst, for each variable I need to define a data frame that stores the conversion from number to meaningful category. Fortunately, this information was found in the codebook, and I can copy and paste these code conversions into separate .txt files and save them in the data/ folder: states.txt, occupation_industry.txt, occupation_category.txt, etc. I can then read them into R as tab-delimited text files.\nIn case you’re interested, after copying the subsets of the codebook, my project directory now looks like this:\n\ndata/\n  atus_00002.csv.gz\n  atus_00002.txt\n  education_level.txt\n  employment_status.txt\n  family_income.txt\n  marital_status.txt\n  occupation_category.txt\n  occupation_industry.txt\n  race.txt\n  sex.txt\n  state.txt\nR/\n  clean.R\n  load.R\n\nI now start work on a convertClass() function which will be the third component of my cleanData() function. The first thing I do in convertClass() is convert the id variable to a factor. I then loop through each of the other factor variables to read in the code conversions from the .txt files, join the meaningful factors onto the original data frame using left_join() and remove the numeric version of the variable. The function that I wrote is presented below. I spent a while playing around in the console with various versions of the function below (always running code from the .R file rather than typing directly in the console itself).\n\nconvertClass <- function(data, path_to_codes = \"data/\") {\n  # convert id to a factor\n  data <- data %>% mutate(id = as.factor(id))\n  # loop through each of the factor variables and convert to meaningful\n  # factor then add to data frame\n  for (variable in c(\"state\", \"occupation_industry\", \"occupation_category\",\n                       \"education_level\", \"race\", \"marital_status\", \"sex\",\n                       \"employment_status\", \"family_income\")) {\n    # identify the path to the code file\n    path <- paste0(path_to_codes, variable, \".txt\")\n    # read in the code file\n    codes <- read.table(path, sep = \"\\t\")\n    # remove the second column (the entries are separated by two \\t's)\n    codes <- codes[, -2]\n    # convert the column names\n    colnames(codes) <- c(variable, paste0(variable, \"_name\"))\n    # add the code to the original data frame\n    data <- left_join(data, codes, by = variable)\n    # remove old variable and replace with new variable\n    data[, variable] <- data[, paste0(variable, \"_name\")]\n    data <- data[, !(colnames(data) %in% paste0(variable, \"_name\"))]\n  }\n  return(data)\n}\n\nAfter I was done, I tested out that the convertClass() did what I hoped by running the following code in the console:\n\n# run the convertClass() function\ntime_use <- convertClass(time_use)\n# compare the original variables with the meaningful versions\nhead(time_use)\n\n              id year num_contacts                state household_size\n1 20160101160045 2016            1              Georgia              3\n2 20160101160066 2016            1             Virginia              2\n3 20160101160069 2016            2 District of Columbia              4\n4 20160101160083 2016            1             Michigan              4\n5 20160101160084 2016            1             Missouri              2\n6 20160101160094 2016            0              Florida              5\n       family_income num_children num_adults age    sex\n1   $7,500 to $9,999            0          3  62 Female\n2 $15,000 to $19,999            0          2  69   Male\n3 $10,000 to $12,499            2          2  24 Female\n4 $25,000 to $29,999            3          1  31 Female\n5 $60,000 to $74,999            0          2  59 Female\n6 $12,500 to $14,999            4          1  16 Female\n                             race           marital_status\n1                      White only Married -

    "title": "Alternatives to grouped bar charts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At some point in your life you have probably found yourself standing face-to-face with a beast known as a grouped bar chart. Perhaps it was in a research paper where the authors were trying to compare the results of several models across different datasets, or it was in a talk given by a colleague who was trying to compare the popularity of different products among distinct groups of consumers.\nThe first time you encountered a grouped bar chart you might have thought “what a neat way to put so much information in a single plot!”. However, the moment you started trying to see whether the orange bar always does better than the green bar but worse than the blue bar.\nIn the example below (made with ggplot2), I show a simple grouped bar chart comparing research funding success rates across a variety of disciplines with the data split into two categories for each discipline: males and females. This data came from Rafael Irizarry’s excellent R package, dslabs, containing datasets for teaching data science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in this simple example, I find it really difficult to compare male and female funding success rates across genders. Are the males having more success than the females overall? It’s genuinely hard to tell unless I examine each discipline closely and see that men are doing better in the first two groups, but not the two after that, and then I think they are doing a bit better in the categories after that, but now I’m having a hard time and I really want to stop looking at this plot now…\nFortunately, people such as Ann K. Emery (in her post on grouped bar charts) have thought about how to represent this information in a better way. Below I will show 2 alternative approaches (slope charts and horizontal dot plots).\nWhile these are not necessarily “standard” plot types (as in there is no specific geom_ for them), true freedom in visualization comes with the realization that most plots are just arrangements of circles and lines in space. When you truly embrace this idea, you can make any type of figure you want! By means of demonstration, in my next post I show the ggplot2 R code for making each plot.\n\nSlope plots\nThe first alternative is similar to parallel coordinates plots for multi-variate data visualization. The slope plot contains two axes (or three or four, depending on how many groups you have), one for each group (male and female). The disciplines are each represented by a line connecting the male success rates to the female success rates in as coded by their y-position. This plot makes it very clear for which disciplines women have greater funding success than men (the upward sloping, darker colored lines) and it also makes it very clear which disciplines have higher funding success rates overall (Physics and Chemical sciences).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see much more clearly is that the number of disciplines in which men are more successful is similar to the number of disciplines in which women are more successful. The discipline with the most similar success rates between men and women is the Chemical sciences. All of this information was very difficult to obtain from the grouped bar chart!\n\n\nHorizontal dot plots\nAnother alternative is the horizontal dot plot: In this case each discipline is again represented by a line, but instead of coding the success rates as the y-position at the end of the discipline slope, the success rate is coded as the x-position along the discipline-specific horizontal line. I have ordered the disciplines by the women’s funding success rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor me, the horizontal dot plot highlights that in the disciplines with lower funding rates overall (the bottom few rows), men have higher success rates.\nRegardless of your preference, it is fairly clear that both the slope plot and the horizontal dot plots are easier to digest than the grouped bar plot!\n\n\nCode\nMy next post shows the ggplot2 code that I wrote to produce the three plots in this post.\n\n\nReferences\n\nThe research funding data comes from Rafael Irizarry’s dslabs R package\nThe slope and dot plot ideas for this post come from Ann K. Emery’s post on the same topic."

    "text": "Basic ggplot2\nIn this section, we are going to make our first plot. This plot will be based on the gapminder dataset that can be found here. Below, we show the first 6 rows of the gapminder dataset.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# to download the data directly:\ngapminder <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv\")\n\n\nhead(gapminder)\n\n      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453\n2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530\n3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007\n4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971\n5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811\n6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134\n\n\nThe first function we will use is ggplot(). This function allows us to define the data that we will be using to make the plot, as well as the aesthetic properties that will be mapped to the geometric objects. That is, we will tell ggplot which data (a data frame) we are interested in and how each of the variables in our dataset will be used (e.g. as an x or y coordinate, as a coloring variable or a size variable, etc).\nBelow, we define our first ggplot object using the ggplot function, with the gapminder dataset and the x and y aesthetics defined by the gdpPercap and lifeExp variables, respectively.\nThe output of this function is a grid with gdpPercap as the x-axis and lifeExp as the y-axis. However, we have not yet told ggplot what type of geometric object the data will be mapped to, so no data has been displayed.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic mapping to layers\nNext, we will add a “geom” layer to our ggplot object. For example, we could add a points layer which would automatically adopt the aesthetic mapping described in the previous line of code.\n\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have done is map each country (row) in the data to a point in the space defined by the GDP and life expectancy value. The end result is an ugly blob of points. Fortunately, there are many things that we can do to make this blob of points prettier.\nFor example, we can change the transparency of all points by setting the alpha argument to a low value, changing the color of the points to be blue instead of black, and making the points smaller.\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, col = \"cornflowerblue\", size = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the above argument changed the alpha value and color for all of the points at once.\nOne of the truly powerful features of ggplot2 is the ability to change these aesthetics based on the data itself. For example, perhaps we want to color each point by its continent. Instead of separating the data into five different subsets (based on the possible values of continent), and adding the different colored points separately, we can simply add all the points once and add an colour aesthetic map for continent.\nNote that whenever we are using a variable from the data to describe an aesthetic property of a geom, this aesthetic property needs to be included in the aes() function.\n\nunique(gapminder$continent)\n\n[1] \"Asia\"     \"Europe\"   \"Africa\"   \"Americas\" \"Oceania\" \n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also add aesthetic mappings for other features such as shape, size, transparency (alpha), and more! For example, changing the size based on population:\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of layers\nSo far, we have only seen scatterplots (point geoms), however, there are many other geoms we could add, including:\n\nlines\nhistograms\nboxplots and violin plots\nbarplots\nsmoothed curves\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = continent)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = continent), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\", color = \"grey30\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: size\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?"

Arguably, it would be better to show gdpPercap on a logarithmic scale, rather than in its raw form. Fortunately, this is easy to do using a scale function, which can be considered another layer that transforms our plot.\n\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default x- (and y-) axes scales are scale_x_continuous and scale_y_continuous, but other options include scale_x_sqrt and scale_x_reverse.\nEach of these scale functions has many options including changing the limits, the breaks, etc. For example in the plot below, we manipulate the x-axis by providing arguments to our scale function of choice.\n\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  # clean the x-axis breaks\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000),\n                limits = c(1, 120000))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we changed the name of the x-axis in the plot using the name argument. This could also be done using the labs function. As an example, below we add a title and change the name of the y-axis and legends using the labs function.\n\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n  # add scatter points\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  # log-scale the x-axis\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  # change labels\n  labs(title = \"GDP versus life expectancy in 2007\",\n       x = \"GDP per capita (log scale)\",\n       y = \"Life expectancy\",\n       size = \"Popoulation\",\n       color = \"Continent\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also manipulate the scale of the size variable. Below, we expand the range of sizes and clean up the variable name. Since the variable we provided for size is a continuous variable (pop) we use the scale_size_continuous argument.\n\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n  # add scatter points\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  # log-scale the x-axis\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  # change labels\n  labs(title = \"GDP versus life expectancy in 2007\",\n       x = \"GDP per capita (log scale)\",\n       y = \"Life expectancy\",\n       size = \"Popoulation (millions)\",\n       color = \"Continent\") +\n  # change the size scale\n  scale_size(range = c(0.1, 10),\n             breaks = 1000000 * c(250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250),\n             labels = c(\"250\", \"500\", \"750\", \"1000\", \"1250\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScales also exist for other aesthetic features such as fill, color, alpha, etc."

    "text": "Most people who learned R before the tidyverse have likely started to feel a nibble of pressure to get aboard the tidyverse train. Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. As someone first learnt R 10 years ago (long before the tidyverse) I’ve been there. Five years ago, I was pushed to stick my little toe into the shallow-end of the tidyverse pool by learning ggplot2, and I never went back.\nWhile the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. From where I float now substantially closer to the deep-end of the tidyverse pool, I would provide the following arguments you as well as to my past self for why it is a good idea to learn the tidyverse:\nMuch of the initial efforts of the tidyverse were the brainchild of Hadley Wickham, but these days there are a huge number of people who contribute to, maintain, and develop the tidyverse. The tidyverse is open-source and collaborative (which means that you - yes you - could contribute to it if you wanted to), and is hosted on the tidyverse github: https://github.com/tidyverse.\nThe goal of this post is to summarise the overall goals of the tidyverse, provide short tutorials on each of the packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together), and to provide links to additional resources for learning them.\nFor new tidyverse practitioners, I’d recommend focusing on getting a handle on piping %>%, and learning the dplyr and ggplot2 packages (these form part one of this post). Once you feel comfortable with these core aspects of the tidyverse, you can move onto part two of this two-part series on the tidyverse to learn about the remaining packages.\nIt is important to remember that the tidyverse is constantly evolving. The best ways to keep up to date with the evolving tidyverse ecosystem is (1) to follow the RStudio blog (https://blog.rstudio.com/), and (2) start following R people on twitter. Mara Averick (@dataandme) and Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) are good people to follow. A great resource for learning about the tidyverse in more detail is R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham."

To fix this, you will either need to directly call the select() function from the dplyr package using dplyr::select() or ensure that you load such packages before the tidyverse package (which automatically loads the dplyr package)."

The error messages have recently been improved to warn you if you are accidentally using a pipe %>% to add layers to ggplot objects (which, once you start piping everything into everything, becomes an easy mistake to make).\nProbably the most common geom layer is geom_point. Inside geom_point(), you will specify the aesthetic mappings from the variables to the geometric objects that you want. For instance, if you want to plot a scatterplot with gdpPercap on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis, then you would add a geom_point() geometric layer with relevant aesthetic function: geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)).\n\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also add a smoothed trend line layer on top of the points using geom_smooth().\n\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  # add a smoothed LOESS layer\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp), method = \"loess\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that since the aesthetics for geom_point() and geom_smooth() are the same, you might want to just specify global aesthetics in the ggplot() function, rather than layer-specific aesthetics.\n\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  # specify global aesthetic mappings\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point() +\n  # add a smoothed LOESS layer\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also combine a points geom layer with a line geom layer, or any other type of geom layer.

Don’t worry though, your caret code will still work!\nOlder note: This tutorial was based on an older version of the abalone data that had a binary old varibale rather than a numeric age variable. It has been modified lightly so that it uses a manual old variable (is the abalone older than 10 or not) and ignores the numeric age variable.\nMaterials prepared by Rebecca Barter. Package developed by Max Kuhn.\nAn interactive Jupyter Notebook version of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/rlbarter/STAT-215A-Fall-2017/tree/master/week11. Feel free to download it and use for your own learning or teaching adventures!\nR has a wide number of packages for machine learning (ML), which is great, but also quite frustrating since each package was designed independently and has very different syntax, inputs and outputs.\nThis means that if you want to do machine learning in R, you have to learn a large number of separate methods.\nRecognizing this, Max Kuhn (at the time working in drug discovery at Pfizer, now at RStudio) put together a single package for performing any machine learning method you like. This package is called caret. Caret stands for Classification And Regression Training. Apparently caret has little to do with our orange friend, the carrot.\nNot only does caret allow you to run a plethora of ML methods, it also provides tools for auxiliary techniques such as:\nAn extensive vignette for caret can be found here: https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html"

    "text": "A simple view of caret: the default train function\nTo implement your machine learning model of choice using caret you will use the train function. The types of modeling options available are many and are listed here: https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html. In the example below, we will use the ranger implementation of random forest to predict whether abalone are “old” or not based on a bunch of physical properties of the abalone (sex, height, weight, diameter, etc). The abalone data came from the UCI Machine Learning repository (we split the data into a training and test set).\nFirst we load the data into R:\n\n# load in packages\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(ranger)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(e1071)\n# load in abalone dataset\nabalone_data <- read.table(\"data/abalone.data\", sep = \",\")\n# load in column names\ncolnames(abalone_data) <- c(\"sex\", \"length\", \"diameter\", \"height\", \n                            \"whole.weight\", \"shucked.weight\", \n                            \"viscera.weight\", \"shell.weight\", \"age\")\n# add a logical variable for \"old\" (age > 10)\nabalone_data <- abalone_data %>%\n  mutate(old = age > 10) %>%\n  # remove the \"age\" variable\n  select(-age)\n# split into training and testing\nset.seed(23489)\ntrain_index <- sample(1:nrow(abalone_data), 0.9 * nrow(abalone_data))\nabalone_train <- abalone_data[train_index, ]\nabalone_test <- abalone_data[-train_index, ]\n# remove the original dataset\nrm(abalone_data)\n# view the first 6 rows of the training data\nhead(abalone_train)\n\n     sex length diameter height whole.weight shucked.weight viscera.weight\n232    M  0.565    0.440  0.175       0.9025         0.3100         0.1930\n3906   M  0.380    0.270  0.095       0.2190         0.0835         0.0515\n1179   F  0.650    0.500  0.190       1.4640         0.6415         0.3390\n2296   F  0.520    0.415  0.145       0.8045         0.3325         0.1725\n1513   F  0.650    0.500  0.160       1.3825         0.7020         0.3040\n1023   F  0.640    0.500  0.170       1.5175         0.6930         0.3260\n     shell.weight   old\n232        0.3250  TRUE\n3906       0.0700 FALSE\n1179       0.4245 FALSE\n2296       0.2850 FALSE\n1513       0.3195 FALSE\n1023       0.4090  TRUE\n\n\nIt looks like we have 3,759 abalone:\n\ndim(abalone_train)\n\n[1] 3759    9\n\n\nTime to fit a random forest model using caret. Anytime we want to fit a model using train we tell it which model to fit by providing a formula for the first argument (as.factor(old) ~ . means that we want to model old as a function of all of the other variables).

    "title": "Tidymodels: tidy machine learning in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a new modeling pipeline in town: tidymodels. Over the past few years, tidymodels has been gradually emerging as the tidyverse’s machine learning toolkit.\nWhy tidymodels? Well, it turns out that R has a consistency problem. Since everything was made by different people and using different principles, everything has a slightly different interface, and trying to keep everything in line can be frustrating. Several years ago, Max Kuhn (formerly at Pfeizer, now at RStudio) developed the caret R package (see my caret tutorial) aimed at creating a uniform interface for the massive variety of machine learning models that exist in R. Caret was great in a lot of ways, but also limited in others. In my own use, I found it to be quite slow whenever I tried to use on problems of any kind of modest size.\nThat said, caret was a great starting point, so RStudio hired Max Kuhn to work on a tidy version of caret, and he and many other people have developed what has become tidymodels. Tidymodels has been in development for a few years, with snippets of it being released as they were developed (see my post on the recipes package). I’ve been holding off writing a post about tidymodels until it seemed as though the different pieces fit together sufficiently for it to all feel cohesive. I feel like they’re finally there - which means it is time for me to learn it! While caret isn’t going anywhere (you can continue to use caret, and your existing caret code isn’t going to stop working), tidymodels will eventually make it redundant.\nThe main resources I used to learn tidymodels were Alison Hill’s slides from Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse, which contains all the slides for the course she prepared with Garrett Grolemund for RStudio::conf(2020), and Edgar Ruiz’s Gentle introduction to tidymodels on the RStudio website.\nNote that throughout this post I’ll be assuming basic tidyverse knowledge, primarily of dplyr (e.g. piping %>% and function such as mutate()). Fortunately, for all you purrr-phobes out there, purrr is not required. If you’d like to brush up on your tidyverse skills, check out my Introduction to the Tidyverse posts. If you’d like to learn purrr (purrr is very handy for working with tidymodels but is no longer a requirement), check out my purrr post.\n\nWhat is tidymodels\nMuch like the tidyverse consists of many core packages, such as ggplot2 and dplyr, tidymodels also consists of several core packages, including\n\nrsample: for sample splitting (e.g. train/test or cross-validation)\nrecipes: for pre-processing\nparsnip: for specifying the model\nyardstick: for evaluating the model\n\nSimilarly to how you can load the entire tidyverse suite of packages by typing library(tidyverse), you can load the entire tidymodels suite of packages by typing library(tidymodels).\nWe will also be using the tune package (for parameter tuning procedure) and the workflows package (for putting everything together) that I had thought were a part of CRAN’s tidymodels package bundle, but apparently they aren’t. These will need to be loaded separately for now.\nUnlike in my tidyverse post, I won’t base this post around the packages themselves, but I will mention the packages in passing.\n\n\nGetting set up\nFirst we need to load some libraries: tidymodels and tidyverse.\n\n# load the relevant tidymodels libraries\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(workflows)\nlibrary(tune)\n\nIf you don’t already have the tidymodels library (or any of the other libraries) installed, then you’ll need to install it (once only) using install.packages(\"tidymodels\").\nWe will use the Pima Indian Women’s diabetes dataset which contains information on 768 Pima Indian women’s diabetes status, as well as many predictive features such as the number of pregnancies (pregnant), plasma glucose concentration (glucose), diastolic blood pressure (pressure), triceps skin fold thickness (triceps), 2-hour serum insulin (insulin), BMI (mass), diabetes pedigree function (pedigree), and their age (age). In case you were wondering, the Pima Indians are a group of Native Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona. The short name, “Pima” is believed to have come from a phrase meaning “I don’t know,” which they used repeatedly in their initial meetings with Spanish colonists.

recorded as zeros. See for instance the histogram of the tricep skin fold thickness, which has a number of 0 entries that are set apart from the other entries.\n\nggplot(diabetes_orig) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = triceps))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomena can also seen in the glucose, pressure, insulin and mass variables. Thus, we convert the 0 entries in all variables (other than “pregnant”) to NA. To do that, we use the mutate_at() function (which will soon be superseded by mutate() with across()) to specify which variables we want to apply our mutating function to, and we use the if_else() function to specify what to replace the value with if the condition is true or false.\n\ndiabetes_clean <- diabetes_orig %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(triceps, glucose, pressure, insulin, mass), \n            function(.var) { \n              if_else(condition = (.var == 0), # if true (i.e. the entry is 0)\n                      true = as.numeric(NA),  # replace the value with NA\n                      false = .var # otherwise leave it as it is\n                      )\n            })\n\nOur data is ready. Hopefully you’ve replenished your cup of tea (or coffee if you’re into that for some reason). Let’s start making some tidy models!\n\n\nSplit into train/test\nFirst, let’s split our dataset into training and testing data. The training data will be used to fit our model and tune its parameters, where the testing data will be used to evaluate our final model’s performance.\nThis split can be done automatically using the inital_split() function (from rsample) which creates a special “split” object.\n\nset.seed(234589)\n# split the data into trainng (75%) and testing (25%)\ndiabetes_split <- initial_split(diabetes_clean, \n                                prop = 3/4)\ndiabetes_split\n\n<Training/Testing/Total>\n<576/192/768>\n\n\nThe printed output of diabetes_split, our split object, tells us how many observations we have in the training set, the testing set, and overall: <train/test/total>.\nThe training and testing sets can be extracted from the “split” object using the training() and testing() functions. Although, we won’t actually use these objects in the pipeline (we will be using the diabetes_split object itself).\n\n# extract training and testing sets\ndiabetes_train <- training(diabetes_split)\ndiabetes_test <- testing(diabetes_split)\n\nAt some point we’re going to want to do some parameter tuning, and to do that we’re going to want to use cross-validation. So we can create a cross-validated version of the training set in preparation for that moment using vfold_cv().\n\n# create CV object from training data\ndiabetes_cv <- vfold_cv(diabetes_train)\n\n\n\nDefine a recipe\nRecipes allow you to specify the role of each variable as an outcome or predictor variable (using a “formula”), and any pre-processing steps you want to conduct (such as normalization, imputation, PCA, etc).\nCreating a recipe has two parts (layered on top of one another using pipes %>%):\n\nSpecify the formula (recipe()): specify the outcome variable and predictor variables\nSpecify pre-processing steps (step_zzz()): define the pre-processing steps, such as imputation, creating dummy variables, scaling, and more\n\nFor instance, we can define the following recipe\n\n# define the recipe\ndiabetes_recipe <- \n  # which consists of the formula (outcome ~ predictors)\n  recipe(diabetes ~ pregnant + glucose + pressure + triceps + \n           insulin + mass + pedigree + age, \n         data = diabetes_clean) %>%\n  # and some pre-processing steps\n  step_normalize(all_numeric()) %>%\n  step_impute_knn(all_predictors())\n\nIf you’ve ever seen formulas before (e.g. using the lm() function in R), you might have noticed that we could have written our formula much more efficiently using the formula short-hand where . represents all of the variables in the data: outcome ~ . will fit a model that predicts the outcome using all other columns.\nThe full list of pre-processing steps available can be found here. In the recipe steps above we used the functions all_numeric() and all_predictors() as arguments to the pre-processing steps. These are called “role selections”, and they specify that we want to apply the step to “all numeric” variables or “all predictor variables”. The list of all potential role selectors can be found by typing ?selections into your console.\nNote that we used the original diabetes_clean data object (we set recipe(..., data = diabetes_clean)), rather than the diabetes_train object or the diabetes_split object. It turns out we could have used any of these. All recipes takes from the data object at this point is the names and roles of the outcome and predictor variables. We will apply this recipe to specific datasets later. This means that for large data sets, the head of the data could be used to pass the recipe a smaller data set to save time and memory.\nIndeed, if we print a summary of the diabetes_recipe object, it just shows us how many predictor variables we’ve specified and the steps we’ve specified (but it doesn’t actually implement them yet!).\n\ndiabetes_recipe\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 8\n\n\n\n\n\n── Operations \n\n\n• Centering and scaling for: all_numeric()\n\n\n• K-nearest neighbor imputation for: all_predictors()\n\n\nIf you want to extract the pre-processed dataset itself, you can first prep() the recipe for a specific dataset and juice() the prepped recipe to extract the pre-processed data. It turns out that extracting the pre-processed data isn’t actually necessary for the pipeline, since this will be done under the hood when the model is fit, but sometimes it’s useful anyway.\n\ndiabetes_train_preprocessed <- diabetes_recipe %>%\n  # apply the recipe to the training data\n  prep(diabetes_train) %>%\n  # extract the pre-processed training dataset\n  juice()\ndiabetes_train_preprocessed\n\n# A tibble: 576 × 9\n   pregnant glucose pressure triceps insulin     mass pedigree     age diabetes\n      <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl> <fct>   \n 1   1.23   -0.390    0.262   0.892   -0.317 -0.656      0.502 -0.201  pos     \n 2   0.0447  1.09    -0.0616 -0.0348  -0.219 -0.168     -0.400  0.301  neg     \n 3   1.82    1.91    -0.224   0.595    0.146  0.379     -0.813  0.301  neg     \n 4  -1.14   -0.0948  -0.710  -0.591   -0.522 -0.311      3.76  -1.04   neg     \n 5  -0.548   0.233    0.424   0.706    0.239  1.56       2.25  -0.201  pos     \n 6   0.637  -0.0620  -1.84   -0.683    0.190 -0.771      2.53  -0.0335 pos     \n 7  -0.844  -1.64    -2.01   -1.05    -0.629 -1.73      -0.445 -0.953  neg     \n 8  -0.548  -0.423   -1.68   -0.313   -0.735  0.00505   -0.460 -0.953  neg     \n 9  -1.14    0.463   -0.386   1.17     0.796  1.41      -0.320 -0.786  pos     \n10   1.53    1.41     0.424   0.150    0.877  0.0482    -0.968  0.969  pos     \n# … with 566 more rows\n\n\nI wrote a much longer post on recipes if you’d like to check out more details. However, note that the preparation and bake steps described in that post are no longer necessary in the tidymodels pipeline, since they’re now implemented under the hood by the later model fitting functions in this pipeline.\n\n\nSpecify the model\nSo far we’ve split our data into training/testing, and we’ve specified our pre-processing steps using a recipe. The next thing we want to specify is our model (using the parsnip package).\nParsnip offers a unified interface for the massive variety of models that exist in R. This means that you only have to learn one way of specifying a model, and you can use this specification and have it generate a linear model, a random forest model, a support vector machine model, and more with a single line of code.\nThere are a few primary components that you need to provide for the model specification\n\nThe model type: what kind of model you want to fit, set using a different function depending on the model, such as rand_forest() for random forest, logistic_reg() for logistic regression, svm_poly() for a polynomial SVM model etc. The full list of models available via parsnip can be found here.\nThe arguments: the model parameter values (now consistently named across different models), set using set_args().\nThe engine: the underlying package the model should come from (e.g. “ranger” for the ranger implementation of Random Forest), set using set_engine().\nThe mode: the type of prediction - since several packages can do both classification (binary/categorical prediction) and regression (continuous prediction), set using set_mode().\n\nFor instance, if we want to fit a random forest model as implemented by the ranger package for the purpose of classification and we want to tune the mtry parameter (the number of randomly selected variables to be considered at each split in the trees), then we would define the following model specification:\n\nrf_model <- \n  # specify that the model is a random forest\n  rand_forest() %>%\n  # specify that the `mtry` parameter needs to be tuned\n  set_args(mtry = tune()) %>%\n  # select the engine/package that underlies the model\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"impurity\") %>%\n  # choose either the continuous regression or binary classification mode\n  set_mode(\"classification\") \n\nIf you want to be able to examine the variable importance of your final model later, you will need to set importance argument when setting the engine. For ranger, the importance options are \"impurity\" or \"permutation\".\nAs another example, the following code would instead specify a logistic regression model from the glm package.\n\nlr_model <- \n  # specify that the model is a random forest\n  logistic_reg() %>%\n  # select the engine/package that underlies the model\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %>%\n  # choose either the continuous regression or binary classification mode\n  set_mode(\"classification\") \n\nNote that this code doesn’t actually fit the model. Like the recipe, it just outlines a description of the model. Moreover, setting a parameter to tune() means that it will be tuned later in the tune stage of the pipeline (i.e. the value of the parameter that yields the best performance will be chosen). You could also just specify a particular value of the parameter if you don’t want to tune it e.g. using set_args(mtry = 4).\nAnother thing to note is that nothing about this model specification is specific to the diabetes dataset.\n\n\nPut it all together in a workflow\nWe’re now ready to put the model and recipes together into a workflow. You initiate a workflow using workflow() (from the workflows package) and then you can add a recipe and add a model to it.\n\n# set the workflow\nrf_workflow <- workflow() %>%\n  # add the recipe\n  add_recipe(diabetes_recipe) %>%\n  # add the model\n  add_model(rf_model)\n\nNote that we still haven’t yet implemented the pre-processing steps in the recipe nor have we fit the model. We’ve just written the framework. It is only when we tune the parameters or fit the model that the recipe and model frameworks are actually implemented.\n\n\nTune the parameters\nSince we had a parameter that we designated to be tuned (mtry), we need to tune it (i.e. choose the value that leads to the best performance) before fitting our model. If you don’t have any parameters to tune, you can skip this step.\nNote that we will do our tuning using the cross-validation object (diabetes_cv). To do this, we specify the range of mtry values we want to try, and then we add a tuning layer to our workflow using tune_grid() (from the tune package). Note that we focus on two metrics: accuracy and roc_auc (from the yardstick package).\n\n# specify which values eant to try\nrf_grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(3, 4, 5))\n# extract results\nrf_tune_results <- rf_workflow %>%\n  tune_grid(resamples = diabetes_cv, #CV object\n            grid = rf_grid, # grid of values to try\n            metrics = metric_set(accuracy, roc_auc) # metrics we care about\n            )\n\nYou can tune multiple parameters at once by providing multiple parameters to the expand.grid() function, e.g. expand.grid(mtry = c(3, 4, 5), trees = c(100, 500)).\nIt’s always a good idea to explore the results of the cross-validation. collect_metrics() is a really handy function that can be used in a variety of circumstances to extract any metrics that have been calculated within the object it’s being used on. In this case, the metrics come from the cross-validation performance across the different values of the parameters.\n\n# print results\nrf_tune_results %>%\n  collect_metrics()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n   mtry .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  <dbl> <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <int>   <dbl> <chr>               \n1     3 accuracy binary     0.762    10  0.0108 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2     3 roc_auc  binary     0.840    10  0.0116 Preprocessor1_Model1\n3     4 accuracy binary     0.767    10  0.0130 Preprocessor1_Model2\n4     4 roc_auc  binary     0.840    10  0.0128 Preprocessor1_Model2\n5     5 accuracy binary     0.766    10  0.0108 Preprocessor1_Model3\n6     5 roc_auc  binary     0.837    10  0.0118 Preprocessor1_Model3\n\n\nAcross both accuracy and AUC, mtry = 4 yields the best performance (just).\n\n\nFinalize the workflow\nWe want to add a layer to our workflow that corresponds to the tuned parameter, i.e. sets mtry to be the value that yielded the best results. If you didn’t tune any parameters, you can skip this step.\nWe can extract the best value for the accuracy metric by applying the select_best() function to the tune object.\n\nparam_final <- rf_tune_results %>%\n  select_best(metric = \"accuracy\")\nparam_final\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   mtry .config             \n  <dbl> <chr>               \n1     4 Preprocessor1_Model2\n\n\nThen we can add this parameter to the workflow using the finalize_workflow() function.\n\nrf_workflow <- rf_workflow %>%\n  finalize_workflow(param_final)\n\n\n\nEvaluate the model on the test set\nNow we’ve defined our recipe, our model, and tuned the model’s parameters, we’re ready to actually fit the final model. Since all of this information is contained within the workflow object, we will apply the last_fit() function to our workflow and our train/test split object. This will automatically train the model specified by the workflow using the training data, and produce evaluations based on the test set.\n\nrf_fit <- rf_workflow %>%\n  # fit on the training set and evaluate on test set\n  last_fit(diabetes_split)\n\nNote that the fit object that is created is a data-frame-like object; specifically, it is a tibble with list columns.\n\nrf_fit\n\n# Resampling results\n# Manual resampling \n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  splits            id               .metrics .notes   .predictions .workflow \n  <list>            <chr>            <list>   <list>   <list>       <list>    \n1 <split [576/192]> train/test split <tibble> <tibble> <tibble>     <workflow>\n\n\nThis is a really nice feature of tidymodels (and is what makes it work so nicely with the tidyverse) since you can do all of your tidyverse operations to the model object. While truly taking advantage of this flexibility requires proficiency with purrr, if you don’t want to deal with purrr and list-columns, there are functions that can extract the relevant information from the fit object that remove the need for purrr as we will see below.\nSince we supplied the train/test object when we fit the workflow, the metrics are evaluated on the test set. Now when we use the collect_metrics() function (recall we used this when tuning our parameters), it extracts the performance of the final model (since rf_fit now consists of a single final model) applied to the test set.\n\ntest_performance <- rf_fit %>% collect_metrics()\ntest_performance\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate .config             \n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1 accuracy binary         0.792 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 roc_auc  binary         0.853 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nOverall the performance is very good, with an accuracy of 0.74 and an AUC of 0.82.\nYou can also extract the test set predictions themselves using the collect_predictions() function. Note that there are 192 rows in the predictions object below which matches the number of test set observations (just to give you some evidence that these are based on the test set rather than the training set).\n\n# generate predictions from the test set\ntest_predictions <- rf_fit %>% collect_predictions()\ntest_predictions\n\n# A tibble: 192 × 7\n   id               .pred_neg .pred_pos  .row .pred_class diabetes .config      \n   <chr>                <dbl>     <dbl> <int> <fct>       <fct>    <chr>        \n 1 train/test split     0.365    0.635      3 pos         pos      Preprocessor…\n 2 train/test split     0.213    0.787      9 pos         pos      Preprocessor…\n 3 train/test split     0.765    0.235     11 neg         neg      Preprocessor…\n 4 train/test split     0.511    0.489     13 neg         neg      Preprocessor…\n 5 train/test split     0.594    0.406     18 neg         pos      Preprocessor…\n 6 train/test split     0.356    0.644     26 pos         pos      Preprocessor…\n 7 train/test split     0.209    0.791     32 pos         pos      Preprocessor…\n 8 train/test split     0.751    0.249     50 neg         neg      Preprocessor…\n 9 train/test split     0.961    0.0385    53 neg         neg      Preprocessor…\n10 train/test split     0.189    0.811     55 pos         neg      Preprocessor…\n# … with 182 more rows\n\n\nSince this is just a normal data frame/tibble object, we can generate summaries and plots such as a confusion matrix.\n\n# generate a confusion matrix\ntest_predictions %>% \n  conf_mat(truth = diabetes, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction neg pos\n       neg 107  17\n       pos  23  45\n\n\nWe could also plot distributions of the predicted probability distributions for each class.\n\ntest_predictions %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_density(aes(x = .pred_pos, fill = diabetes), \n               alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re familiar with purrr, you could use purrr functions to extract the predictions column using pull(). The following code does almost the same thing as collect_predictions(). You could similarly have done this with the .metrics column.\n\ntest_predictions <- rf_fit %>% pull(.predictions)\ntest_predictions\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 192 × 6\n   .pred_neg .pred_pos  .row .pred_class diabetes .config             \n       <dbl>     <dbl> <int> <fct>       <fct>    <chr>               \n 1     0.365    0.635      3 pos         pos      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 2     0.213    0.787      9 pos         pos      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 3     0.765    0.235     11 neg         neg      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 4     0.511    0.489     13 neg         neg      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 5     0.594    0.406     18 neg         pos      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 6     0.356    0.644     26 pos         pos      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 7     0.209    0.791     32 pos         pos      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 8     0.751    0.249     50 neg         neg      Preprocessor1_Model1\n 9     0.961    0.0385    53 neg         neg      Preprocessor1_Model1\n10     0.189    0.811     55 pos         neg      Preprocessor1_Model1\n# … with 182 more rows\n\n\n\n\nFitting and using your final model\nThe previous section evaluated the model trained on the training data using the testing data. But once you’ve determined your final model, you often want to train it on your full dataset and then use it to predict the response for new data.\nIf you want to use your model to predict the response for new observations, you need to use the fit() function on your workflow and the dataset that you want to fit the final model on (e.g. the complete training + testing dataset).\n\nfinal_model <- fit(rf_workflow, diabetes_clean)\n\nThe final_model object contains a few things including the ranger object trained with the parameters established through the workflow contained in rf_workflow based on the data in diabetes_clean (the combined training and testing data).\n\nfinal_model\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: rand_forest()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2 Recipe Steps\n\n• step_normalize()\n• step_impute_knn()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRanger result\n\nCall:\n ranger::ranger(x = maybe_data_frame(x), y = y, mtry = min_cols(~4,      x), importance = ~\"impurity\", num.threads = 1, verbose = FALSE,      seed = sample.int(10^5, 1), probability = TRUE) \n\nType:                             Probability estimation \nNumber of trees:                  500 \nSample size:                      768 \nNumber of independent variables:  8 \nMtry:                             4 \nTarget node size:                 10 \nVariable importance mode:         impurity \nSplitrule:                        gini \nOOB prediction error (Brier s.):  0.1583874 \n\n\nIf we wanted to predict the diabetes status of a new woman, we could use the normal predict() function.\nFor instance, below we define the data for a new woman.\n\nnew_woman <- tribble(~pregnant, ~glucose, ~pressure, ~triceps, ~insulin, ~mass, ~pedigree, ~age,\n                     2, 95, 70, 31, 102, 28.2, 0.67, 47)\nnew_woman\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  pregnant glucose pressure triceps insulin  mass pedigree   age\n     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>\n1        2      95       70      31     102  28.2     0.67    47\n\n\nThe predicted diabetes status of this new woman is “negative”.\n\npredict(final_model, new_data = new_woman)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  .pred_class\n  <fct>      \n1 neg        \n\n\n\n\nVariable importance\nIf you want to extract the variable importance scores from your model, as far as I can tell, for now you need to extract the model object from the fit() object (which for us is called final_model).

    "title": "Thanks, Quarto, for saving my blog!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello reader, it’s been a minute!\nI’m sure you didn’t notice, but I’ve been kind of silent on here for the past three years. So silent, it’s almost deafening (to my ears, at least).\nFear not, there are good reasons for my absence in this space. I’ve actually spent the past three years writing a book called “Veridical Data Science: the practice of responsible data analysis and decision making”, together with my PhD and postdoc advisor, the Veridical Data Science pioneer, Bin Yu. And I was doing this more-or-less full-time (more on veridical data science to come).\nMuch to my dismay, it turns out that after a full day of book-writing1, it’s hard to summon the energy to do even more writing in the form of blog posts. Book-burnout is real. So what was I doing with my spare time2 if I wasn’t blogging, you ask? Instead of writing blog posts, I was doing a lot of non-blogging things like weathering a pandemic, climbing dumb rocks, learning to draw, moving all around the country, and other non-blogging things like that.\nBut now that the book is “done” (as in, it’s been sent to the publishers, which, if you know anything about publishing, means that it’s actually very far from done), and I’ve settled into a new job as an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Utah, I finally feel ready to start blogging again! Hooray!\nExcept… not actually hooray. When I finally went to update my original blogdown website on my new work computer, R yelled at me. Loudly. In red. And I didn’t like it one bit. The day that I had long feared had finally arrived: I didn’t know how to update my own website without breaking it. Blogdown is fantastic until it’s not.\nFortunately, this happened at the best of possible times. Not only have substantially fewer people been following my website lately (that’ll happen when you don’t add anything new to it in three years…), so I’m not so afraid to make some breaking changes, but we are now living in the magical era of Quarto!\nPerhaps you’re like me, and it’s taken you a while to realize why this new era of Quarto is so magic. My first impression of Quarto was that it’s pretty much R Markdown, but with a few extra features and slightly different syntax. This is true, and also not true.\nAfter hearing so much about how much easier so many things (like making a blog, for instance) are with Quarto, I figured that I might as well give it a go and try to port my broken blogdown website over to Quarto. The alternative seems to be spending my life debugging blogdown, so what have I got to lose?\nNow that I’m on the other side, I have to say. Wow. Just wow. I managed to re-create my entire website using quarto without running into a single issue in just 4 hours. For reference, when I originally created my blog using blogdown 5ish years ago, it took around 5 days and I had to try several different themes before I found one that was stable and didn’t break easily.\nIf you’re looking to make the transition yourself, fortunately there are already several useful resources out there, like Albert Rapp’s blog post and Nick Tierney’s blog post. The Quarto documentation itself is also really helpful.\nThe end result of my 4-hours of effort is what you see here. My website looks a bit different (and I got rid of some of the less-visited sections that no one cares about), but I think it’s much cleaner and easier to navigate. I might do some fine-tuning down the line, but I’m in no rush.\nAnyway, all this is to say: Welcome to my new website! I hope to be creating a lot more content for you in the near future. I’m excited to oil to my blogging gears, and get back on the road!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nwhich mostly involves writing the same paragraph in five different ways before realizing that the point I’m trying to make is irrelevant and subsequently deleting the whole thing↩︎\nI know that this implies that I only blog in my spare time, but if I’m being honest, I don’t think I’ve ever actually blogged in my spare time. I only ever blog during work hours, like the responsible employee that I am. I’m actually at work right now. But shhhh.↩︎"

    "title": "Across (dplyr 1.0.0): applying dplyr functions simultaneously across multiple columns",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I often find that I want to use a dplyr function on multiple columns at once. For instance, perhaps I want to scale all of the numeric variables at once using a mutate function, or I want to provide the same summary for three of my variables.\nWhile it’s been possible to do such tasks for a while using scoped verbs, it’s now even easier - and more consistent - using dplyr’s new across() function.\nTo demonstrate across(), I’m going to use Palmer’s Penguin dataset, which was originally collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, but has recently been made popular in the R community by Allison Horst as an alternative to the over-used Iris dataset.\nTo start with, let’s load the penguins dataset (via the palmerpenguins package) and the tidyverse package. If you’re new to the tidyverse (primarily to dplyr and piping, %>%), I suggest taking a look at my post on the tidyverse before reading this post.\n\n# remotes::install_github(\"allisonhorst/palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\npenguins\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_…¹ body_…² sex    year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>      <int>   <int> <fct> <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7        181    3750 male   2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4        186    3800 fema…  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18          195    3250 fema…  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA           NA      NA <NA>   2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3        193    3450 fema…  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6        190    3650 male   2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8        181    3625 fema…  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6        195    4675 male   2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1        193    3475 <NA>   2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2        190    4250 <NA>   2007\n# … with 334 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm,\n#   ²​body_mass_g\n\n\nThere are 344 rows in the penguins dataset, one for each penguin, and 7 columns. The first two columns, species and island, specify the species and island of the penguin, the next four specify numeric traits about the penguin, including the bill and flipper length, the bill depth and the body mass.\nThe new across() function turns all dplyr functions into “scoped” versions of themselves, which means you can specify multiple columns that your dplyr function will apply to.\nOrdinarily, if we want to summarise a single column, such as species, by calculating the number of distinct entries (using n_distinct()) it contains, we would typically write\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(distinct_species = n_distinct(species))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  distinct_species\n             <int>\n1                3\n\n\nIf we wanted to calculate n_distinct() not only across species, but also across island and sex, we would need to write out the n_distinct function three separate times:\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(distinct_species = n_distinct(species),\n            distinct_island = n_distinct(island),\n            distinct_sex = n_distinct(sex))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  distinct_species distinct_island distinct_sex\n             <int>           <int>        <int>\n1                3               3            3\n\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if we could just write which columns we want to apply n_distinct() to, and then specify n_distinct() once, rather than having to apply n_distinct to each column separately?\nThis is where across() comes in. It is used inside your favourite dplyr function and the syntax is across(.cols, .fnd), where .cols specifies the columns that you want the dplyr function to act on. When dplyr functions involve external functions that you’re applying to columns e.g. n_distinct() in the example above, this external function is placed in the .fnd argument. For example, we would to apply n_distinct() to species, island, and sex, we would write across(c(species, island, sex), n_distinct) in the summarise parentheses.\nNote that we are specifying which variables we want to involve in the summarise using c(), as if we’re listing the variable names in a vector, but because we’re in dplyr-land, we don’t need to put them in quotes:\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(c(species, island, sex), \n                   n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  species island   sex\n    <int>  <int> <int>\n1       3      3     3\n\n\nSomething else that’s really neat is that you can also use !c() to negate a set of variables (i.e. to apply the function to all variables except those that you specified in c()):\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(!c(species, island, sex), \n                   n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g  year\n           <int>         <int>             <int>       <int> <int>\n1            165            81                56          95     3\n\n\nI want to emphasize here that the function n_distinct() is an argument of across(), rather than being an argument of the dplyr function (summarise).\n\nSelect helpers: selecting columns to apply the function to\nSo far we’ve seen how to apply a dplyr function to a set of columns using a vector notation c(col1, col2, col3, ...). However, there are many other ways to specify the columns that you want to apply the dplyr function to.\n\neverything(): apply the function to all of the columns\n\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(everything(), n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_leng…¹ body_…²   sex  year\n    <int>  <int>          <int>         <int>          <int>   <int> <int> <int>\n1       3      3            165            81             56      95     3     3\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g\n\n\n\nstarts_with(): apply the function to all columns whose name starts with a specific string\n\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(starts_with(\"bill\"), n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n           <int>         <int>\n1            165            81\n\n\n\ncontains(): apply the function to all columns whose name contains a specific string\n\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(contains(\"length\"), n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n           <int>             <int>\n1            165                56\n\n\n\nwhere() apply the function to all columns that satisfy a logical condition, such as is.numeric()\n\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), n_distinct))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g  year\n           <int>         <int>             <int>       <int> <int>\n1            165            81                56          95     3\n\n\nThe full list of select helpers can be found here.\n\n\nUsing in-line functions with across\nLet’s look at an example of summarizing the columns using a custom function (rather than n_distinct()). I usually do this using the tilde-dot shorthand for inline functions. The notation works by replacing\n\nfunction(x) {\n  x + 10\n}\n\nwith\n\n~{.x + 10}\n\n~ indicates that you have started an anonymous function, and the argument of the anonymous function can be referred to using .x (or simply .). Unlike normal function arguments that can be anything that you like, the tilde-dot function argument is always .x.\nFor instance, to identify how many missing values there are in every column, we could specify the inline function ~sum(is.na(.)), which calculates how many NA values are in each column (where the column is represented by .) and adds them up:\n\npenguins %>%\n  summarise(across(everything(), \n                   ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_leng…¹ body_…²   sex  year\n    <int>  <int>          <int>         <int>          <int>   <int> <int> <int>\n1       0      0              2             2              2       2    11     0\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g\n\n\nThis shows that there are missing values in every column except for the first two (species and island).\n\n\nA mutate example\nWhat if we want to replace the missing values in the numeric columns with 0 (clearly a terrible choice)? Without the across() function, we would apply an if_else() function separately to each numeric column, which will replace all NA values with 0 and leave all non-NA values as they are:\n\nreplace0 <- function(x) {\n  if_else(condition = is.na(x), \n          true = 0, \n          false = as.numeric(x))\n}\npenguins %>%\n  mutate(bill_length_mm = replace0(bill_length_mm),\n         bill_depth_mm = replace0(bill_depth_mm),\n         flipper_length_mm = replace0(flipper_length_mm),\n         body_mass_g = replace0(body_mass_g))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_…¹ body_…² sex    year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl> <fct> <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7        181    3750 male   2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4        186    3800 fema…  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18          195    3250 fema…  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen            0             0            0       0 <NA>   2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3        193    3450 fema…  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6        190    3650 male   2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8        181    3625 fema…  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6        195    4675 male   2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1        193    3475 <NA>   2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2        190    4250 <NA>   2007\n# … with 334 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm,\n#   ²​body_mass_g\n\n\nBut fortunately, we can do this a lot more efficiently with across().\n\n# define a function to replace NA with 0\n\npenguins %>%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), replace0))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_…¹ body_…² sex    year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl> <fct> <dbl>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7        181    3750 male   2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4        186    3800 fema…  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18          195    3250 fema…  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen            0             0            0       0 <NA>   2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3        193    3450 fema…  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6        190    3650 male   2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8        181    3625 fema…  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6        195    4675 male   2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1        193    3475 <NA>   2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2        190    4250 <NA>   2007\n# … with 334 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm,\n#   ²​body_mass_g\n\n\nAlthough obviously 0 isn’t a great choice, so perhaps we can replace the missing values with the mean value of the column.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This year I was given the opportunity to talk at rstudio::conf(2020), which, if you’ve never been, is one of those rare conferences where every person you meet is both extremely friendly and excited about R, and you learn a million fun and useful things that you can actually use. 10/10, would go again.\nMy talk was about blogging about R. Specifically, about why I blog, and why you should too, while also giving some tips and tricks for getting started. My slides can are here, if you just want to flick through the slides and get the tl;dr.\n\n\nRead on below if you’re interested in learning more!\n\nWhy start a blog?\nMany years ago, I began to realize that I love to teach and explain things. As it turned out, it doesn’t really matter what the things are, but since I happened to be getting a PhD in statistics, I figured I might as well apply my love of explaining things to my work. Since I decided that I might want to do explain things as a career one day, I decided to start a portfolio in the form of a blog, which turned out to be a great way to practice my explaining skills (which have undoubtedly improved over the past few years). To be honest, I never really expected anyone to pay attention to the things I wrote (and for many years, they didn’t), but I’m pretty excited that you’re here reading this now!\nOne of the main benefits I’ve found since I started my blog several years ago is that I’ve learnt so many things. For starters, having to come up with topics to write about is an excellent way to keep up with what’s current. If you hear about a new R package or statistical concept floating around, but you can’t think of an excuse to learn about it in your every-day work, write a blog post about it! Having to explain something is an excellent way to learn it. Writing a blog post also turns out to be a great way to procrastinate during those afternoons when you can’t force yourself to do your actual work, but you still want to give the illusion (both to your boss and yourself) that you’re being productive.\nSo my top 4 reasons to start a blog:\n\nTo learn!\nPortfolio & gain exposure (people will start to know who you are)\nTo practice your communication skills\nProductive procrastination\n\nBonus reason: someone else might find what you wrote useful and send you a nice email, or even give you a job!\n\n\nHow to choose a topic\nSo you’ve decided you want to start a blog. That’s so awesome! Now how in the world are you supposed to decide what to write about?\nI tend to choose topics in one of two ways:\nWrite about something that you just learned. Especially if you had a hard time learning it, because there weren’t any good resources out there. This is a definite indication that there is a need for a good post about a topic. It happens surprisingly often, even with widely used R packages.\nAlternatively, write about something you want to learn. As I mentioned above, having to explain something to someone else is a great way to learn something thoroughly in the first place.\n\n\nUse interesting and easily accessible data examples\nI always try to use interesting data examples (such as the gapminder dataset), or examples that are humorous in some way (such as the baking data example for my recipes blogpost).\nMaking it very easy for your reader to access the data in their own console is highly recommended. For instance, instead of proving a link where the user can download the data locally to their computer and then load it in to their environment (since who knows where it will end up on their computer relative to their working directory), try to use data examples that can be downloaded directly from a URL. For instance:\n\nmuffin_cupcake_data_orig <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adashofdata/muffin-cupcake/master/recipes_muffins_cupcakes.csv\")\n\n\n\nKeep it simple\nWhen explaining technical concepts, try to stay away from complex terminology, jargon, notation, and if possible, stay away from math altogether. Opt instead for metaphors and images that explain a concept. You’re writing a blog post, not a text book. My advice is always: explain it to your grandmother. Always keep your audience in mind. Err on the side of being too detailed, and assume that your audience is a total newbie. Then the people who already know the basics can skip over your intro-level descriptions and take away the high level info, but this way you’re still making your post accessible to absolute newbies.\nIn addition, avoid saying that things are “obvious”, “easy”, or “trivial”. Just because they are for you, doesn’t mean that they are for everyone, and you’re likely to scare away people who don’t find it obvious, easy, or trivial.\n\n\nCreating and hosting your blog\nI write my blog in RStudio using the blogdown R package, which magically combines many .Rmd files into a webpage. It’s amazing. There are many pre-existing themes that you can choose from that you can modify with a little bit of CSS and html code if you want to.\nI also have a GitHub repository that contains my website, which is where I push any updates I make to my website to. Then I have a Netlify site that mirrors whatever is in the GitHub repository, so that any changes I push are automatically updated.\nA summary of the technical workflow to get the website set up is as follows: make a GitHub repository containing your website, tell Netlify what the repository is called and push. Bam! Your website is now ready!\nIf you’re looking for some more explicit details, here they are:\n\nStart a new github repository for your website and call it anything you like. By that I mean that it doesn’t have to be username.github.io. I called mine personal-webpage. So creative, I know.\nUse the R package blogdown to design your page with Hugo. There are lots of cool themes available. Choose a good one.\nPush your website, content and all, to your new repo.\nHead on over to netlify, create and account/log in and hit “New site from Git”.\n\n\nStep 1: Set the Continuous Deployment Git provider to GitHub (or whichever provider you use).\nStep 2: Choose the repository containing your website.\nStep 3: Set the Build command to hugo_0.19 (or whichever version you want), and the Publish directory to “public” (this is the folder in which Hugo by default puts the actual webpage files when it’s built).\n\n\nHit “Deploy site”.\nIf you like you can choose to “Change site name”.\nYour site can now be found at sitename.netlify.com!\nEvery time you push new content to the GitHub repo, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site. You can just sit back and relax :).\n\nIt’s probably a good idea to buy a domain name from somewhere like Google Domains for like $10/year and point that domain name towards your netlify site, but otherwise you’re good to go!\n\n\nSpreading the word\nTitle your blogs as something people might google, such as “A caret tutorial” (try googling this, and see what comes up ;)). Most of the people who come to my website find it on Google.\nA great way to gain a reader following is Twitter (I’m @rlbarter). Twitter is also a surprisingly effective way to keep up to date with what’s current with the R community. Even though I initially had very few followers, whenever I shared one of my blogs on twitter, it would get a surprisingly large number of re-tweets and likes. It gave me warm fuzzies.\nFinally, another great way to get experience explaining things, and to get your blog (and name) out there is to run tutorials on your favorite blog posts. Reach out to your local R Ladies or UseR! groups, or run a tutorial in your department or company.\n\n\nGo forth and blog!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here I provide the code I used to create the figures from my previous post on alternatives to grouped bar charts. You are encouraged to play with them yourself!\nThe key to creating unique and creative visualizations using libraries such as ggplot (or even just straight SVG) is (1) to move away from thinking of data visualization only as the default plot types (bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots, etc), and (2) to realise that most visualizations are essentially lines and circles that you can arrange however you desire in space. Drawing a picture on paper before beginning to code your data viz is a great way to create customized visualizations for each dataset.\n\nBars\nFirst, I load in the libraries (the data comes from the dslabs library), and convert the data to long-form for creating the grouped bar charts.\n\n# load in libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dslabs)\n# combine male and female success rates into single data frame\nsuccess_rates <- rbind(\n  # male success rates\n  transmute(research_funding_rates, \n            discipline, \n            success = success_rates_men, \n            gender = \"Male\"),\n  # female success rates\n  transmute(research_funding_rates, \n            discipline, \n            success = success_rates_women, \n            gender = \"Female\")) \n\n\n# print the data\nsuccess_rates\n\n            discipline success gender\n1    Chemical sciences    26.5   Male\n2    Physical sciences    19.3   Male\n3              Physics    26.9   Male\n4           Humanities    14.3   Male\n5   Technical sciences    15.9   Male\n6    Interdisciplinary    11.4   Male\n7  Earth/life sciences    24.4   Male\n8      Social sciences    15.3   Male\n9     Medical sciences    18.8   Male\n10   Chemical sciences    25.6 Female\n11   Physical sciences    23.1 Female\n12             Physics    22.2 Female\n13          Humanities    19.3 Female\n14  Technical sciences    21.0 Female\n15   Interdisciplinary    21.8 Female\n16 Earth/life sciences    14.3 Female\n17     Social sciences    11.5 Female\n18    Medical sciences    11.2 Female\n\n\nI used geom_bar() to create a grouped bar chart containing the data. I grouped by gender by setting fill = gender within the aes() function.\n\n# make grouped bar plot\nggplot(success_rates) +\n  # add bar for each discipline colored by gender\n  geom_bar(aes(x = discipline, y = success, fill = gender),\n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  # name axes and remove gap between bars and y-axis\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Success Rate\", expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\"Discipline\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#468189\", \"#9DBEBB\")) +\n  # remove grey theme\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  # rotate x-axis and remove superfluous axis elements\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, \n                                   hjust = 1, vjust = 0),\n        axis.line = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope plot\nTo create the sloped chart, it ends up being easier to keep the data in its original wide form.\nThe first element I add is the slopes from men to women using geom_segment(). Each slope is colored based on whether men or women are more successful.\n\ngg_slope <- research_funding_rates %>%\n  # add a variable for when men are more successful than women (for colours)\n  mutate(men_more_successful = success_rates_men > success_rates_women) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # add a line segment that goes from men to women for each discipline\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 1, xend = 2, \n                   y = success_rates_men, \n                   yend = success_rates_women,\n                   group = discipline,\n                   col = men_more_successful), \n               size = 1.2) +\n  # set the colors\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#468189\", \"#9DBEBB\"), guide = \"none\")  +\n  # remove all axis stuff\n  theme_classic() + \n  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank()) \ngg_slope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I add a left and right axis at the start and end of the slopes.\n\ngg_slope <- gg_slope +\n  # add vertical lines that act as axis for men\n  geom_segment(x = 1, xend = 1, \n               y = min(research_funding_rates$success_rates_men) - 2,\n               yend = max(research_funding_rates$success_rates_men) + 1,\n               col = \"grey70\", size = 0.5) +\n  # add vertical lines that act as axis for women\n  geom_segment(x = 2, xend = 2, \n               y = min(research_funding_rates$success_rates_men) - 2,\n               yend = max(research_funding_rates$success_rates_men) + 1,\n               col = \"grey70\", size = 0.5) +\n  # add the words \"men\" and \"women\" above their axes\n  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),\n            data = data.frame(x = 1:2, \n                              y = 2 + max(research_funding_rates$success_rates_men),\n                              label = c(\"men\", \"women\")),\n            col = \"grey30\",\n            size = 6) \ngg_slope  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also need to add an identifier for each discipline’s slope. I do this by annotating the plot with text.\n\ngg_slope <- gg_slope +\n  # add the label and success rate for each discipline next the men axis\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1 - 0.03, \n                y = success_rates_men, \n                label = paste0(discipline, \", \", \n                               round(success_rates_men, 1), \"%\")),\n             col = \"grey30\", hjust = \"right\") +\n  # add the success rate next to each point on the women axis\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2 + 0.08, \n                y = success_rates_women, \n                label = paste0(round(success_rates_women, 1), \"%\")),\n            col = \"grey30\") +\n  # set the limits of the x-axis so that the labels are not cut off\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 2.1)) \ngg_slope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I decide to add points (for aesthetic purposes). Behind each circle, I add a slightly larger white circle to act as a border and to give a slight “gap” look.\n\ngg_slope <- gg_slope + \n  \n  # add the white outline for the points at each rate for men\n  geom_point(aes(x = 1, \n                 y = success_rates_men), size = 4.5,\n             col = \"white\") +\n  # add the white outline for the points at each rate for women\n  geom_point(aes(x = 2, \n                 y = success_rates_women), size = 4.5,\n             col = \"white\") +\n  \n  # add the actual points at each rate for men\n  geom_point(aes(x = 1, \n                 y = success_rates_men), size = 4,\n             col = \"grey60\") +\n  # add the actual points at each rate for men\n  geom_point(aes(x = 2, \n                 y = success_rates_women), size = 4,\n             col = \"grey60\") \ngg_slope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal dots\nTo create the horizontal dot plot, I again keep the data in its original wide-form but I arrange the disciplines in order of women’s success rate (this will make the plot easier to read).\nThe first things I do to create the dot plot is add the horizontal discipline lines and the points for the success rates of men and women.\n\ngg_dot <- research_funding_rates %>%\n  # rearrange the factor levels for discipline by rates for women\n  arrange(success_rates_women) %>%\n  mutate(discipline = fct_inorder(discipline)) %>%\n  \n  ggplot() +\n  # remove axes and superfluous grids\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.line = element_blank()) +\n  \n  \n  # add a dummy point for scaling purposes\n  geom_point(aes(x = 12, y = discipline), \n             size = 0, col = \"white\") + \n  \n  # add the horizontal discipline lines\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1:9, col = \"grey80\") +\n  \n  # add a point for each male success rate\n  geom_point(aes(x = success_rates_men, y = discipline), \n             size = 11, col = \"#9DBEBB\") +\n  # add a point for each female success rate\n  geom_point(aes(x = success_rates_women, y = discipline),\n             size = 11, col = \"#468189\") \ngg_dot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I really like to annotate my figures with text so that the audience can work less hard, I add the success rate on top of each dot. I also prefer to annotate features my plot directly instead of using legends, so I also add a label for men and women.\n\ngg_dot <- gg_dot + \n  # add the text (%) for each male success rate\n  geom_text(aes(x = success_rates_men, y = discipline, \n                label = paste0(round(success_rates_men, 1))),\n            col = \"black\") +\n  # add the text (%) for each female success rate\n  geom_text(aes(x = success_rates_women, y = discipline, \n                label = paste0(round(success_rates_women, 1))),\n            col = \"white\") +\n  # add a label above the first two points\n  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = y, label = label, col = label),\n            data.frame(x = c(25.6 - 1.1, 26.5 + 0.6), y = 10, \n                       label = c(\"women\", \"men\")), size = 6) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9DBEBB\", \"#468189\"), guide = \"none\") +\n  \n  # manually specify the x-axis\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 20, 25), \n                     labels = c(\"15%\", \"20%\", \"25%\")) +\n  # manually set the spacing above and below the plot\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.2, 0)) \ngg_dot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nThe research funding data comes from Rafael Irizarry’s dslabs R package\nThe slope and dot plot ideas for this post come from Ann K. Emery’s post on the same topic."

    "text": "Pre-processing data in R used to be the bane of my existence. For something that should be fairly straightforward, it often really wasn’t. Often my frustrations stemmed from simple things such as factor variables having different levels in the training data and test data, or a variable having missing values in the test data but not in the training data. I’d write a function that would pre-process the training data, and when I’d try to apply it to the test data, R would cry and yell and just be generally unpleasant.\nThankfully most of the pain of pre-processing is now in the past thanks to the recipes R package that is a part of the new “tidymodels” package ecosystem (which, I guess is supposed to be equivalent to the data-focused “tidyverse” package ecosystem that includes dplyr, tidyr, and other super awesome packages like that). Recipes was developed by Max Kuhn and Hadley Wickham.\nSo let’s get baking!"

    "text": "Writing and applying the recipe\nNow that we’ve set up our data, we’re ready to write some recipes and do some baking! The first thing we need to do is get the ingredients. We can use formula notation within the recipe() function to do this: the thing we’re trying to predict is the variable to the left of the ~, and the predictor variables are the things to the right of it (Since I’m including all of my variables, I could have written type ~ .).\n\n# define the recipe (it looks a lot like applying the lm function)\nmodel_recipe <- recipe(type ~ flour + milk + sugar + butter + egg + \n                         baking_powder + vanilla + salt + additional_ingredients, \n                       data = muffin_cupcake_train)\n\nIf we print a summary of the model_recipe object, it just shows us the variables we’ve specified, their type, and whether they’re a predictor or an outcome.\n\nsummary(model_recipe)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   variable               type      role      source  \n   <chr>                  <list>    <chr>     <chr>   \n 1 flour                  <chr [2]> predictor original\n 2 milk                   <chr [2]> predictor original\n 3 sugar                  <chr [2]> predictor original\n 4 butter                 <chr [2]> predictor original\n 5 egg                    <chr [2]> predictor original\n 6 baking_powder          <chr [2]> predictor original\n 7 vanilla                <chr [2]> predictor original\n 8 salt                   <chr [2]> predictor original\n 9 additional_ingredients <chr [3]> predictor original\n10 type                   <chr [3]> outcome   original\n\n\n\nWriting the recipe steps\nSo now we have our ingredients, we are ready to write the recipe (i.e. describe our pre-processing steps). We write the recipe one step at a time. We have many steps to choose from, including:\n\nstep_dummy(): creating dummy variables from categorical variables.\nstep_zzzimpute(): where instead of “zzz” it is the name of a method, such as step_knnimpute(), step_meanimpute(), step_modeimpute(). I find that the fancier imputation methods are reeeeally slow for decently large datasets, so I would probably do this step outside of the recipes package unless you just want to do a quick mean or mode impute (which, to be honest, I often do).\nstep_scale(): normalize to have a standard deviation of 1.\nstep_center(): center to have a mean of 0.\nstep_range(): normalize numeric data to be within a pre-defined range of values.\nstep_pca(): create principal component variables from your data.\nstep_nzv(): remove variables that have (or almost have) the same value for every data point.\n\nYou can also create your own step (which I’ve never felt the need to do, but the details of which can be found here https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/articles/Custom_Steps.html).\nIn each step, you need to specify which variables you want to apply it to. There are many ways to do this:\n\nSpecifying the variable name(s) as the first argument\nStandard dplyr selectors:\n\neverything() applies the step to all columns,\ncontains() allows you to specify column names that contain a specific string,\nstarts_with() allows you to specify column names that start with a sepcific string,\netc\n\nFunctions that specify the role of the variables:\n\nall_predictors() applies the step to the predictor variables only\nall_outcomes() applies the step to the outcome variable(s) only\n\nFunctions that specify the type of the variables:\n\nall_nominal() applies the step to all variables that are nominal (categorical)\nall_numeric() applies the step to all variables that are numeric\n\n\nTo ignore a specific column, you can specify it’s name with a negative sign as a variable (just like you would in select())\n\n# define the steps we want to apply\nmodel_recipe_steps <- model_recipe %>% \n  # mean impute numeric variables\n  step_impute_mean(all_numeric()) %>%\n  # convert the additional ingredients variable to dummy variables\n  step_dummy(additional_ingredients) %>%\n  # rescale all numeric variables except for vanilla, salt and baking powder to lie between 0 and 1\n  step_range(all_numeric(), min = 0, max = 1, -vanilla, -salt, -baking_powder) %>%\n  # remove predictor variables that are almost the same for every entry\n  step_nzv(all_predictors()) \n\n\nmodel_recipe_steps\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n── Inputs \n\n\nNumber of variables by role\n\n\noutcome:   1\npredictor: 9\n\n\n\n\n\n── Operations \n\n\n• Mean imputation for: all_numeric()\n\n\n• Dummy variables from: additional_ingredients\n\n\n• Range scaling to [0,1] for: all_numeric(), -vanilla, -salt, -baking_powder\n\n\n• Sparse, unbalanced variable filter on: all_predictors()\n\n\nNote that the order in which you apply the steps does matter to some extent. The recommended ordering (taken from here) is\n\nImpute\nIndividual transformations for skewness and other issues\nDiscretize (if needed and if you have no other choice)\nCreate dummy variables\nCreate interactions\nNormalization steps (center, scale, range, etc)\nMultivariate transformation (e.g. PCA, spatial sign, etc)\n\n\n\nPreparing the recipe\nNext, we need to provide a dataset on which to base the pre-processing steps. This allows the same recipe to be applied to multiple datasets.\n\nprepped_recipe <- prep(model_recipe_steps, training = muffin_cupcake_train)\n\n\nprepped_recipe\n\n\n\n\n── Recipe

recipe\nNext, you apply your recipe to your datasets.\nSo what did our recipe do?\n\nstep_meanimpute(all_numeric()) imputed all of the missing values with the mean value for that variable\nstep_dummy(additional_ingredients) converted the additional_ingredients into three dummy variables corresponding to three of the four levels of the original variable\nstep_range(all_numeric(), min = 0, max = 1, -vanilla, -salt, -baking_powder) converted the range of all of the numeric variables except for those specified to lie between 0 and 1\nstep_nzv(all_predictors()) removed the salt variable since it was 0 across all rows (except where it was missing)\n\n\nmuffin_cupcake_train_preprocessed <- bake(prepped_recipe,

    "title": "Transitioning into the tidyverse (part 2)",
    "section": "Gathering and spreading",
    "text": "Gathering and spreading\nThe main tidyr functions are spread() and gather(). If you are familiar with the older reshape2 R package, you can think of tidyr as the tidyverse version, where spread() is the equivalent of cast, and gather() is the equivalent of melt(). If not… never mind!\nThink of spread() as a function that will spread a single variable’s “values” across multiple columns based on a “key”, or grouping variable. Similarly, think of gather() as a function that will gather a variable whose “values” are spread across multiple columns (where the “key” is the grouping variable that distinguishes the columns) into a single column.\nThe main things you need to figure out when using spread() and gather() are what are the “key” and what are the “value” columns of your data frame. If you are spreading your data (to make it wider), then your key and value variables are existing variables in the data. If you are gathering your data (making it longer), then you will need to define key and value variables that will become variable names in your long-form data frame.\nBelow I’ll show how this works with a small subset of the gapminder dataset, corresponding to the life expectancy for US, Australia, and Canada for each year in the data after 1990.\nSuppose that you started with the long-form data.\n\ngapminder_sample_long <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(country %in% c(\"Australia\", \"United States\", \"Canada\"), year > 1990) %>%\n  select(country, year, lifeExp) \ngapminder_sample_long\n\n         country year lifeExp\n1      Australia 1992  77.560\n2      Australia 1997  78.830\n3      Australia 2002  80.370\n4      Australia 2007  81.235\n5         Canada 1992  77.950\n6         Canada 1997  78.610\n7         Canada 2002  79.770\n8         Canada 2007  80.653\n9  United States 1992  76.090\n10 United States 1997  76.810\n11 United States 2002  77.310\n12 United States 2007  78.242\n\n\nA wide-form version might have the life expectancy variable spread into three variables, one for each country (it would also be perfectly feasible to separate by year). So in this case, the value that you want to spread is the lifeExp variable, and the key that you want to spread/group by is the country variable.\n\ngapminder_sample_wide <- gapminder_sample_long %>% \n  spread(key = country, value = lifeExp)\ngapminder_sample_wide\n\n  year Australia Canada United States\n1 1992    77.560 77.950        76.090\n2 1997    78.830 78.610        76.810\n3 2002    80.370 79.770        77.310\n4 2007    81.235 80.653        78.242\n\n\nSo the columns with the country names, Australia, Canada, and United States contain the lifeExp values corresponding to those countries for each year. Note that the year variable has been retained in the wide form. If you had tried to do this without the year variable in the data frame, you would run into an error that said \"Error: Each row of output must be identified by a unique combination of keys.\" Try running the following code.\n\ngapminder_sample_long %>%\n  select(-year) %>%\n  spread(key = country, value = lifeExp)\n\nThis is because when the year column is missing, there is no variable that tells purrr which values should go in the same rows together. This error message is a common source of frustration in tidyr, and Hadley has been working on replacements for gather() and spread() called pivot_wider() and pivot_longer(): https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html. They haven’t been incorporated into the CRAN versions of tidyr and the tidyverse yet though, but they probably will be soon. If you understand the principles of gather() and spread() then when the new pivot functions are introduced, it will be easy to learn how to use them.\nIf you wanted to go from the wide form to the long-form, you need to gather together the life expectancy values. This time, the country key and lifeExp value variable names do not currently exist in the data frame. The key and value arguments that you provide in the gather() function are what will be used as the names of the variables for the long-form version you’re about to create. Just so you can see that these variables did not need to exist in the original data, you will call the key country_var and the value lifeExp_var (previously unused names).\n\ngapminder_sample_wide\n\n  year Australia Canada United States\n1 1992    77.560 77.950        76.090\n2 1997    78.830 78.610        76.810\n3 2002    80.370 79.770        77.310\n4 2007    81.235 80.653        78.242\n\ngapminder_sample_wide %>% \n  gather(key = country_var, value = lifeExp_var)\n\n     country_var lifeExp_var\n1           year    1992.000\n2           year    1997.000\n3           year    2002.000\n4           year    2007.000\n5      Australia      77.560\n6      Australia      78.830\n7      Australia      80.370\n8      Australia      81.235\n9         Canada      77.950\n10        Canada      78.610\n11        Canada      79.770\n12        Canada      80.653\n13 United States      76.090\n14 United States      76.810\n15 United States      77.310\n16 United States      78.242\n\n\nOh no…. something went wrong! The year variable has been included as a key (country). Since there is no distinction between the three country columns (Australia, Canada, and United States) and the year column, the year column was included in the gathering process. To exclude a column from the gathering process, you can explicitly remove it using e.g. -year as an argument to the gather function.\n\ngapminder_sample_wide %>% \n  gather(key = country_var, value = lifeExp_var, -year)\n\n   year   country_var lifeExp_var\n1  1992     Australia      77.560\n2  1997     Australia      78.830\n3  2002     Australia      80.370\n4  2007     Australia      81.235\n5  1992        Canada      77.950\n6  1997        Canada      78.610\n7  2002        Canada      79.770\n8  2007        Canada      80.653\n9  1992 United States      76.090\n10 1997 United States      76.810\n11 2002 United States      77.310\n12 2007 United States      78.242"

    "text": "Handling dates and times: lubridate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLubridate makes it really straightforward to deal with dates. One might say… it lubricates them… one might also not say that, because it’s a bit weird.\nLubridate offers a simple way of converting dates/times stored as strings to dates/times stored as dates/times, and it makes it easy to do math with dates.\nThe primary set of functions are date-time-reading functions that convert strings to dates. To decide which function to use, you will need to figure out what format your dates are in (by… looking at them…). For instance, if your date is coded as \"August 2nd 2019\" or \"08-05-19\" or \"08/02/19\", then you would use the mdy() function because it is coded as “month-day-year”:\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nmdy(\"August 2nd 2019\")\n\n[1] \"2019-08-02\"\n\nmdy(\"8-2-2019\")\n\n[1] \"2019-08-02\"\n\nmdy(\"8/2/19\")\n\n[1] \"2019-08-02\"\n\n\nIf your dates were coded as “year-month-day” then you would use the ymd() function, and so on.\nStrings that contain times can be parsed using hms() for “hour-minute-second”.\n\nhms(\"8:45:12\")\n\n[1] \"8H 45M 12S\"\n\n\nAnd date-times can be parsed using ymd_hms(), ymd_hm(), ymd_h(), as well as for the other date versions (mdy_hms(), dmy_hms(), etc…).\n\nmdy_hms(\"March 13th 2019 at 9:02:00\")\n\n[1] \"2019-03-13 09:02:00 UTC\"\n\nmdy_hm(\"03-13-19, 9:02\")\n\n[1] \"2019-03-13 09:02:00 UTC\"\n\n\nYou can add fixed periods of time to dates easily using the years(), months(), days(), hours(), etc… functions. For instance:\n\nmdy(\"August 2nd 2019\") + days(42)\n\n[1] \"2019-09-13\"\n\n\nOnce your dates are in an actual date format, you can do intuitive mathematical calculations with date-times:\n\nmdy_hms(\"August 2nd 2019, 1:21:30 pm\") - mdy_hms(\"August 1st 2019, 11:23:33 am\")\n\nTime difference of 1.08191 days\n\n\nPlus ggplot2 handles lubridate-dates really well."

Fortunately, since I discovered the forcats package, my factors have been on their best behaviour.\nThe forcats package has a few really useful functions. The ones I use most often are\n\nfct_inorder() for reordering the levels of a factor so that the levels are in the order that they appear in the factor vector.\nfct_infreq() for reordering the levels of a factor so that the levels are in order of most to least frequent.\nfct_rev() for reversing the order of the levels of a factor.\nfct_relevel() for manually reordering the levels of the factor.\nfct_reorder() for reordering the levels based on their relationship to another variable.\n\nThere are other functions too, but I rarely use them. Check out the forcats cheatsheet!\nAn example of how the forcats package makes my life easier is when I want to reorder the factor levels. Factor levels are usually alphabetical by default, and I often want the factor levels to be in a specific order.\nAs an exercise both in ggplot2 and dplyr, I want to make a plot that shows the difference between life expectancy between 2007 and 1952 and arrange the countries in order of greatest difference in life expectancy.\n\ngapminder_life_exp_diff <- gapminder %>%\n  # filter to the starting and ending years only\n  filter(year == 1952 | year == 2007) %>%\n  # ensure that the data are arranged so that 1952 is first and 2007 is second \n  # within each year\n  arrange(country, year) %>%\n  # for country, add a variable corresponding to the difference between life \n  # expectency in 2007 and 1952\n  group_by(country) %>%\n  mutate(lifeExp_diff = lifeExp[2] - lifeExp[1],\n         # also calculate the largest population for the country (based on the two years)\n         max_pop = max(pop)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # arrange in order of the biggest difference in life expectency\n  arrange(lifeExp_diff) %>%\n  # restrict to countries with a population of at least 30,000 so we can fit \n  # the plot in a reasonable space\n  filter(max_pop > 30000000) %>%\n  select(country, year, continent, lifeExp, lifeExp_diff)\ngapminder_life_exp_diff  \n\n# A tibble: 72 × 5\n   country          year continent lifeExp lifeExp_diff\n   <chr>           <int> <chr>       <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1 South Africa     1952 Africa       45.0         4.33\n 2 South Africa     2007 Africa       49.3         4.33\n 3 Congo Dem.

Since the countries in our data frame is arranged in order of smallest to biggest difference in life expectancy, one would expect that the plot will be too. However, the countries in the plot still appear in alphabetical order! The problem is that ggplot2 plots factors in order of their levels, but the arrange() dplyr function rearranges the order of the rows in the data frame but does not change the order of the factor levels.\n\ngapminder_life_exp_diff %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, col = as.factor(year)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I tried to fix this using base R, I would undoubtedly end up messing up which country is which. Fortunately this is really, really easy to fix using forcats! The fct_inorder() function will automatically reorder the levels of a factor in the order in which they appear in the vector. So all I need to do is add one line of pre-processing code before I make my plot: mutate(country = fct_inorder(country)).\n\ngapminder_life_exp_diff %>%\n  mutate(country = fct_inorder(country)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, col = as.factor(year)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m a bit pedantic about data viz, so I can’t leave this plot looking like this, so I’m just going to place some ggplot2 code here for making this plot waaaaay more badass. Try to read through the code and understand what its doing. This isn’t a lesson in forcats, it’s a lesson in EDA!\n\ngapminder_life_exp_diff %>%\n  mutate(country = fct_inorder(country)) %>%\n  # for each country define a varaible for min and max life expectancy\n  group_by(country) %>%\n  mutate(max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp),\n         min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # plot a horizontal line from min to max life expectency for each country\n  geom_segment(aes(x = min_lifeExp, xend = max_lifeExp, \n                   y = country, yend = country,\n                   col = continent), alpha = 0.5, size = 7) +\n  # add a point for each life expectancy data point\n  geom_point(aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, col = continent), size = 8) +\n  # add text of the country name as well as the max and min life expectency \n  geom_text(aes(x = min_lifeExp + 0.7, y = country, \n                label = paste(country, round(min_lifeExp))), \n            col = \"grey50\", hjust = \"right\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = max_lifeExp - 0.7, y = country, \n                label = round(max_lifeExp)), \n            col = \"grey50\", hjust = \"left\") +\n  # ensure that the left-most text is not cut off \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(20, 85)) +\n  # choose a different colour palette\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Pastel2\") +\n  # set the title\n  labs(title = \"Change in life expectancy\",\n       subtitle = \"Between 1952 and 2007\",\n       x = \"Life expectancy (in 1952 and 2007)\",\n       y = NULL, \n       col = \"Continent\") +\n  # remove the grey background\n  theme_classic() +\n  # remove the axes and move the legend to the top\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", \n        axis.line = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank())\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead."

    "section": "Consider your audience",
    "text": "Consider your audience\nGiving the same presentation to vastly different groups of people is a definite no-no. For example, when I’m presenting to my biological collaborators, I need to simplify the technical details and can focus less on the biology background than when I’m presenting to my more data-literate peers. On the other hand, if I’m presenting to a lay-audience who is unfamiliar with both the technical details of the methods I’m using as well as the biology, I will remove all mathematical notation and stick to explanatory pictures that describe what I’m doing.\nOn that note, statisticians tend to fill their slides with far too much math even for a technical audience. Even the most accomplished statisticians cannot absorb all that notation at once! Whenever possible, try to use annotated graphics in place of equations.\nOne tip to try to tailor your talk to your audience is to ask the following questions:\nHow much background does my audience have? If they have a strong math background, I can assume that they know the basics and don’t need to explain them in excruciating detail, but if they don’t know any biology, I need to give a very simple explanation in lay-terms of the how the process works.\nWhat is it that I want my audience to take away from my presentation? If I want them to be able to walk away and implement my method, I will give many more details, but if, as is more likely the case, I simply want them to have a broad understanding of why my project is important and how I’ve solved the problem at hand, then I can keep most of the details to myself and present a very high-level picture."

    "text": "Tell a story\nEveryone enjoys a good story (but few people truly enjoy listening to a long, dry proof). Your talk should follow a structure as follows:\nThe setup: what is the context?\nThe issue: what was the problem that prompted your project?\nThe resolution: what steps did you take to solve the problem? What’s are the next steps?\nFor example, I am currently working on a project involving kidney transplants in HIV patients. My story is as follows:\nThe setup: due to prolonged survival of HIV patients, additional complications including HIV-associated nephrology (kidney disease) are becomming more common resulting in an increased demand for kidney transplants among this population.\nThe issue: HIV-positive kidney transplant patients suffer from acute rejection of their transplanted kidney at a significantly higher rate than their HIV-negative counterparts.\nThe resolution: we are developing models for predicting acute rejection in the hopes of elucidating the cause of this increased rejection rate.\n\nTransition slides\nTransition slides are a great way to separate one part of your story from another. Their presence serves to indicate to the audience that you’re moving onto something new. They are particularly effective if your main content slides and your transition slides have different color templates. For example in the presentation above, the content slides have a white background and black text (with a blue heading), but the transition slides have a blue background with white text.\nThe stark difference between content and transition is an incredibly effective way to teach the audience that a blue slide with white text means that we’re moving onto something new."

Of course your talk is going to begin with motivation, followed by a review of the literature, at which point you will move onto your contributions, show me some results and then conclude. This is the basic structure of every academic talk, ever.\nA much better outline slide tells the audience what you are going to talk about, not the skeletal structure of a general presentation.\nFor example, an outline for my kidney transplant project might look more like this:\n\nWhy HIV causes kidney disease\nOutline of the UCSF Study\nCohort selection (and why we struggled with it)\nDynamic approaches to predicting rejection\nAnd why they don’t work well (yet…)"

    "text": "Slide contents\n\nNo walls of text please!\nThe golden rule of making presentations should be with text, less is always more. There is a nice TED blog that has a nice paragraph discussing this point that I’m going to shamelessly drop here:\n\nOne thing to avoid—slides with a lot of text, especially if it’s a repeat of what you’re saying out loud. It’s like if you give a paper handout in a meeting—everyone’s head goes down and they read, rather than staying heads-up and listening. If there are a lot of words on your slide, you’re asking your audience to split their attention between what they’re reading and what they’re hearing. That’s really hard for a brain to do, and it compromises the effectiveness of both your slide text and your spoken words. If you can’t avoid having text-y slides, try to progressively reveal text (like unveiling bullet points one by one) as you need it.\n\nI particularly like the point about how having a lot of text on your slides forces your audience to split their attention between reading and listening without achieving either goal successfully, because it’s so true!.\nIt’s important to realize that this holds true even if all of your text lives in bullet point format.\n\n\nFont size\nOne of the worst (but incredibly common) mistakes that people make when preparing slides is tiny font size. Anything smaller than 18pt is way too small! This is equally (possible, even more) true for figures. Pro-tip: make the axis labels, legend and annotations obnoxiously large.\n\n\nImages\nImages are a great way to lighten up your presentation. Try to find simple photos relevant to the point being made on the slide.\nFor example, I recently made a presentation that included a section on “Weak learners”, which are basically a number of classification models that each individually perform poorly (at least a little better than random guessing), but when pooled together made a powerful learning algorithm.\nI included an image alongside my description displaying an army of soldiers. Get it?"

While I will often start this way, as I start filling in the content, I will subsequently do a lot of moving things around, merging sections, and adding new ones.\n\nRepetition for emphasis\nIf there is something that is really crucial to your story say it many, many times. Often in bold font and in a different color. Say it in different ways, and keep coming back to it verbally: “remember that here we don’t have a control group, well blah blah blah”. Sometimes it’s okay to even tell your audience that you’re emphasizing something by saying something like “just in case it’s not obvious, I’m really trying to emphasize this point”."

Perhaps you’re just happy to see that the author used ggplot rather than base R plot…\nTo be honest, I think this plot is a mess; the colors are distracting, the axis labels are useless, the text is way too small and the heading “Results” is entirely uninformative.\nFortunately, there are many ways that we can make it better: we can\n\nuniversally increase the font size,\nhighlight our method in bold and blue, while fading the competing methods into the background by shading them in grey,\ngive the figure informative axis names,\nmake an informative slide header with the take-away message that “our method has lower prediction error than the competitors”.\n\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more tips like this, I encourage you to check out Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s book, Storytelling with Data, which I really enjoyed. It is a great read if you want to learn how to present your figures to maximize impact and to use your data to tell a story.\nAnother important step to presenting results is to treat the audience like idiots. Trust me, they’ll appreciate it (mostly becauase they won’t realize that you’re doing it). Explain in excruciating detail what every single element of your figure means. For example, in presenting the plot above, rather than simply saying “this plot shows that our method clearly outperforms our competitors”, I would say:\n\n“In the figure on this slide, we are plotting the prediction error rate over time. That means that the lower the error, the better. The x-axis depicts time, while the y-axis depicts the error rate at that time for each method reporesented by the three lines. Our method is highlighted in blue and we see that the error rate hovers around 10%, but that this is better than our competitors whose error rates tend to lie between 12 and 16% or so.\n\nJust because your figure is obvious to you after having put a lot of thought into making the figure in the first place, that doesn’t mean that it is obvious to your audience who have viewed the figure for a total of 2 seconds.\n\nPresenting many plots on the same slide\nI have seen far to many presentations where the presenter moves to the next slide and, BAM! - 10 plots that look almost identical are shoved in my face all at the same time. My brain subsequently has a meltdown and stops listening to a word the presenter is saying while I try to figure out what this army of plots is showing me.\nHere is a simple example that I found on the interwebs:\n\n\n\nIf you have to show a plot with many, many panels (perhaps from simulations under different paramter settings), then a much more effective way to present these results is to reveal them one-by-one, and explain what each plot shows as it is revealed, and how it compares to the previous plots."

Enthusiasm is encouraged - no one wants to listen to someone talk for an hour when they dont even sound excited about what they’re presenting. Varying the tone of your voice is very helpful with exuding an aura of enthusiasm.\nEye contact is also vital. Why should your audience pay attention to you if you aren’t paying attention to them? If you are nervous, one idea is to pick a few spots in the back of the room, above people’s heads and look at those.\nLastly, my greatest tip of all is to use humour, but only if you feel comfortable doing so (I actually find that using humour helps me relax).

    "text": "Confounders are the worst!\nSuppose that we have conducted a randomized experiment in which we measure some outcome (say mortality) within two groups, treated and untreated, into which individuals were randomly assigned. In this case, the random assignment of treatment means that there should, on average, be no significant differences between the treated and untreated groups. Thus, any difference in mortality that we observe between the treated group and the untreated group must be due to the treatment itself (as this is the only thing that differs between the treated and untreated groups).\nOne of the primary problems that arise when attempting to estimate average causal effects in an observational study (i.e. a study in which the individuals assign themselves into a treatment group, e.g. because they themselves choose to smoke or not, rather than a scientist choosing for them) is that there may exist differences between the treated group and the untreated group, other than the treatment itself, such as gender (males are more likely to smoke).\nWhy is this a problem? Basically, if there is something other than the treatment that differs between the treated and untreated groups, then we cannot conclusively say that any difference observed in mortality (or any other outcome of interest) between the two groups is due solely to the treatment. Such a difference could also plausibly be due to these other variables that differ between these groups. These variables that differ between the treatment and control groups are called confounders if they also influence the outcome.\nFor a simplified example, it is known that males are more likely to smoke than females, but males are also more likely to die young as a result of other general risk-raking behavior. In this case, if we notice a difference in mortality between smokers and non-smokers, we cannot be sure that this difference is due to the smoking rather than the fact that the group of smokers consists more of males than the control group and subsequently (as a result of the risk-taking behavior, rather than just the smoking) the treatment group has a higher mortality rate than the untreated group. In this case, the higher mortality rate among smokers has nothing to do with (or at least is not entirely due to) the smoking itself, but rather is to do gender discrepancies and the differences in risk-taking behaviors afforded by such a discrepancy.\nIn the graph below, our example corresponds to the outcome, \\(Y\\), mortality; the treatment, \\(T\\), smoking, and the confounder, \\(X\\), gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if gender differed between the treatment and untreated group (e.g. smokers vs non-smokers), but had no association with the outcome (e.g. mortality), then gender would not be considered a confounder (as it would not be a common cause of treatment the and outcome).\nClearly estimating causal effects in the presence of confounders is going to be a problem!"

    "text": "Suppose, as many do, that we want to estimate the effect of an action (or treatment) on an outcome. As an example, we might be interested in estimating the effect of receiving a drug vs not receiving a drug on the incidence of heart disease. In an ideal futuristic world, we would take each individual in our population and split them into two identical humans: one who receives the treatment and the other who doesn’t. Since these two humans are 100% identical in every way other than the treatment received, any difference we subsequently observe in their outcome (i.e. development of heart disease) must be due to the effect of the treatment alone.\nUnfortunately, since our humble 21st-century technology does not yet posses a human-duplication machine, the natural thing to do is to split our existing population of humans randomly into two groups: those who are to receive the drug (the treatment group) and those who won’t (the control group).\nSince there was nothing special about how we determined who gets the drug and who doesn’t, on average, there should be no difference between the treatment group and control group other than in the treatment itself. Thus, comparing the incidence of heart disease in the treatment group and in the control group should give us a reasonable estimate of the average effect of the treatment in the population.\n\nUnobserved confounding in observational studies\nWhile the randomized experiment is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in many situations, unfortunately there are many more scenarios where we can’t just randomly assign the treatment. For instance in the case of the effect of organ transplants on survival, it is probably not the best idea to randomly assign transplants to people. Instead, those who receive transplants first are those who need it the most. Such a study is necessarily observational: we simply observe who happened to receive a transplant based on the existing system.\nIt is highly likely that there will be fairly extreme differences between those who receive a transplant earlier and those who receive one later; namely that those who are transplanted earlier are much sicker than those who are transplanted later. Thus, differences in survival between those who receive a transplant within a month (our definition of the treatment group) and those who receive a transplant in more than one month (our definition of the control group) cannot be attributable solely to the time of the transplant itself, but also to the fact that the earlier transplantees were sicker at the start of the study. Thus sickness is a confounder: something that is different between the treatment and control groups other than the treatment itself that also affects the outcome.\nIf you’d like to quickly brush up on your causal inference, the fundamental issue associated with making causal inferences, and in particular, the troubles that arise in the presence of confounding, you might like to take a peak at my earlier post on this topic.\nIf a confounder is observable, you can adapt your estimator using methods such as matching or regression adjustment to obtain an unbiased treatment effect estimate. The key issue that I will explore in this post is what to do when you have unobserved confounding. For example, what if we cannot quantitatively measure “sickness” (the variable that determines whether you will be transplanted soon or not) and so transplants between blood-type compatible donors and recipients are assigned primarily based on sickness as measured by a doctor’s intuition (a fundamentally unmeasurable quantity). Note that this isn’t actually how transplants are allocated, but it will serve nicely for instrumental variables explanation purposes.\n\n\nWhat is an instrument and can I play it?\nIn most situations, if you have an unobservable confounder, there isn’t too much you can do to get around it since changes in the treatment will necessarily also change the confounder (in ways we cannot measure), both of which will in turn change the outcome. In this case, there is no way to measure the effect of the treatment alone (i.e. in isolation from the confounder) on the outcome.\nIn a few situations, however, you will have an instrument. An instrument, it turns out, is not a tuba, a piano, nor a flute, but rather an instrument is a magical measurable quantity that happens to be correlated with the treatment, and is only related to the outcome via the treatment (the instrument has no influence on the outcome except via the fact that it influences the treatment which inturn influences the outcome). The second part of this definition (that the instrument is only related to the outcome via the treatment) is called the exclusion restriction.\nIn our transplant setting, a particularly nice instrument is blood type. Patients with blood type AB can receive organs from donors with any blood type (and donors with blood type AB can only donate to recipients with blood type AB), whereas patients with blood type O can only receive organs from donors with blood type O (but donors with blood type O can donate to recipients of any blood type). The result is that patients with blood type O will, in general, need to wait longer for a transplant than patients of a similar sickness level with blood type AB.\nSince this is a lot to explain in words, below you will find a picture that demonstrates how recipients with blood type AB have a larger pool of potential donors than do recipients with blood type O. An arrow from a donor blood type to a recipient blood type implies that donors with the specified blood type can donate organs to the corresponding recipient blood type. Since we will focus only on blood types AB and O (pretending that blood types A and B don’t exist for technical convenience), these two blood types have been enclosed in a snug little box within the diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea behind instrumental variables is that the changes in treatment that are caused by the instrument are unconfounded (since changes in the instrument will change the treatment but not the outcome or confounders) and can thus be used to estimate the treatment effect (among those individuals who are influenced by the instrument). This idea will be explained in great detail in the next section, but for now I will try to convince you that blood type is indeed an instrument.\nClearly blood type will affect the treatment (whether or not the patient is transplanted within a month), but for blood type to be an instrument, we also need to make sure that blood type has no effect on the outcome (other than through it’s effect on the treatment). That is, we need to check the exclusion restriction. It turns out that, unfortunately, the exclusion restriction is uncheckable (similarly to how it is impossible to check that there are no unobserved confounders). The exclusion restriction will forever remain a critical assumption that will need to be backed up by domain knowledge.\nIn the blood type case, it is easy to find faults in the exclusion restriction assumption: it is well-known that blood type and race are correlated, and that race and life-expectancy are correlated (implying that blood type and survival might be related via race). However, to keep things simple, we will define our outcome to be a binary variable corresponding to whether or not death occurs within 1 year. It is highly unlikely that blood type will be related to such a short term survival outcome, even via correlation with race. Moreover, blood type is more-or-less randomly assigned (given your parent’s blood type). In this case, the exclusion restriction is fairly plausible, but in many IV setups, a lot of care will need to be taken to back up the exclusion restriction assumption.\nNow that we (hopefully) understand what an instrument is, the next question is how to use it (don’t worry if you have no idea why instruments are useful yet, it’s not at all obvious!).\n\n\nHow do instruments work?\nOur big question is whether there is an effect of being transplanted within one month (the treatment) on death within 1 year (the outcome). However, our standard approaches to estimating the treatment effect are foiled by the presence of unobserved confounding by sickness, a feature that we cannot accurately quantify. If we could accurately measure an individual’s level of sickness then we could adjust for it using regression adjustment or matching techniques. In our case, however, sickness is defined based on doctor intuition (an unmeasurable quantity), so these traditional approaches to dealing with confounding cannot help us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, we have an instrument (blood type) which modifies the treatment (time to transplantation) without modifying any confounders (the exclusion restriction says that the instrument has no effect on the outcome in any way except through the treatment - this would not be true if the instrument was correlated with a confounder). The exclusion restriction is embodied by the lack of an arrow between the instrument (blood type) and the outcome (death within 1 year) in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, since the instrument affects the outcome solely through the treatment, any observed difference between the outcome (survival) between different levels of the instrument (blood types) must be due to the subsequent differences in the treatment (wait time).\nIt turns out that the effect of having blood type AB versus blood type O is that an individual is 7% less likely to die within 1 year. Since under the exclusion restriction there is no direct effect of blood type on death within 1 year (except via the treatment), this must be due to the difference in transplant wait time (the treatment) between the blood types.\nSince patients with blood type AB are 23% more likely to be transplanted within 1 month than patients with blood type O, we can conclude that the effect of a 23% increase in the chance of being transplanted within 1 month is a 7% decrease in the chance of death within one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, to scale up the effect of “being 23% more likely to be transplanted within a month” to the effect of “being 100% more likely to be transplanted within a month” (i.e. of being transplanted within a month vs not being transplanted within a month) is equal to\n\\[\\frac{\\textrm{Effect of AB vs O on death in 1 year}}{\\textrm{Effect of AB vs O on transplantation in 1 month}} = \\frac{-0.07}{0.23} = -0.3\\]\nThat is, being transplanted within 1 month decreases the chance of death within 1 year by 30%!\nIt is important to note that since we are estimating the effect of changes in the treatment that were caused by the instrument only (rather than the effects of arbitrary changes in the treatment), the instrumental variables treatment effect estimate is not for the entire population, but only for those who are influenced in some way by the instrument (the “compliers”). Thus this estimate is called the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE).\nThe estimator above is often referred to as the Wald estimator and can be written as\n\\[\\textrm{Wald estimator} = \\frac{\\textrm{Cov(outcome, instrument)}}{\\textrm{Cov(treatment, instrument)}}\\]\nIn practice, IV is often implemented in a two-stage lease squares (2SLS) procedure that can be shown quite easily to be equivalent to the Wald estimator in simple cases (i.e. when not adjusting for other variables).\n\n\nResources\n\nThe resource that I found to be most useful was Chapter 10.5 of Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill’s book Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models\nThe series of YouTube videos by Ben Lambert were also really helpful https://youtu.be/NLgB2WGGKUw\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nIt turns out that you can quantify sickness in the context of liver transplantation using something called the MELD score (model for end-stage liver disease score). But even if we know current MELD score, future MELD score will still be a confounder since if your MELD rapidly increases then you are getting sicker faster and will be transplanted sooner.\nIf there is anything that is unclear in this post, please feel free to ask questions in the comments section so that I can improve it."
