I am available for consulting for a wide range of projects and I regularly teach multi-day workshops for small and large groups.

The kinds of topics I love teaching include programming skills such as:

- R

- Python

- SQL

- Git/GitHub

- Shell/UNIX

As well as more general data science skills including:

- Data cleaning

- Data visualization

- Data science workflows
