The raw data itself should never be touched manually. Instead, you should have scripts or notebooks that load the raw data into an R or Python environment for in-environment data manipulation (this will not modify the raw data files themselves).\n\nAny data that is produced by code should be saved in the `data/processed_data/` subdirectory.\n\n#### Documents\n\nThis is a good place to keep meeting notes, data dictionaries, and any other associated materials.\n\n\n#### Code\n\nThere are three types of code documents:\n\n1. **Function scripts** (.R, .py): scripts that contain reusable functions that will be called in the action scripts below (and possibly in the exploration notebooks). By convention, function scripts are given the name `xx_funs_yy.R`, where `xx` is a number and `yy` describes what the functions are for (e.g. `01_funs_clean_data.R`).\n\n1. **Action scripts** (.R, .py): scripts that perform activities such as a detailed data cleaning pipeline, or running many models. Often these scripts will load in data, do something to it (e.g. clean it or fit a model to it) and will then save a new object (such as a cleaned dataset or model results). By convention, action scripts are given the name `xx_do_yy.R`, where `xx` is a number and `yy` describes what action is undertaken by running the script (e.g. `01_do_clean_data.R`).\n\n1. **Exploration notebooks** (.Rmd, .ipynb): R Markdown or Jupyter notebook files that are used to produce figures and explanatory files that contain figures and explanations of data cleaning steps and results of analyses. These are the files that an external viewer would find useful to understand your data and analysis.\n\nScripts that are run sequentially are numbered accordingly. An example of a project structure is shown below. Note that in the example below the functions folder is nested as a subdirectory of the scripts folder which contains the actionable scripts. This makes sense when the functions are only called in the actionable scripts (but not in the exploration notebooks).\n\n\n```\nproject\n│   README.md\n└───data/\n│       └───raw_data/\n│           │   data_orig.csv\n│       └───processed_data/\n│           │   data_clean.csv\n│       └───results/\n│           │   model_results.csv\n└───documents/\n│       meeting_notes.md\n│       data_dictionary.md\n└───code/\n│       └───exploration/\n│           │   01_data_exploration.Rmd\n│           │   02_model_results.Rmd\n│       └───scripts/\n│           │   01_do_clean_data.R\n│           │   02_do_model_data.R\n│           └───functions/\n│               │   01_funs_clean_data.R\n│               │   02_funs_model_data.R\n\n```\n\n### Syntax and conventions\n\nAll filenames are always lowercase and use underscores to separate words.\n\nCode should follow an appropriate style guide:\n\n- R: [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (based on the R Google Style Guide)\n- Python: [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)\n\n\n### Resources\n\n- I wrote a much more detailed blog post on my workflow a few years ago that can be found here: [http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-08-16-data-science-workflow/](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-08-16-data-science-workflow/).
