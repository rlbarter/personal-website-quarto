In this post, I outline the workflow that I have developed over the last few years."},"headingText":"Obtaining the data from the website","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nDeveloping a seamless, clean workflow for data analysis is harder than it sounds, especially because this is something that is almost never explicitly taught. Apparently we are all just supposed to \"figure it out for ourselves\". For most of us, when we start our first few analysis projects, we basically have no idea how we are going to structure all of our files, or even what files we will need to make. As we try more and more things in our analysis (perhaps generating a large number of unnecessary files called `analysis2.R`, `next-analysis.R`, `analysis-writeup.Rmd`, `data_clean.csv`, `regression_results.csv` and `data_all.csv` along the way), we find that our project folder gets jumbled and confusing. The frustration when we come back to the project 6 months later and can't remember which file contained the code that lead to the final conclusions is all too real.\n\nThis is why I have decided to describe in (possibly too much) detail the data cleaning workflow that I have somehow ended up with. I find this workflow to be particularly useful when dealing with messy (and possibly large) datasets that need several cleaning steps. Note that I did not develop this workflow in conjunction with any resources, I simply figured out what worked best for me via trial-and-error (a process which took 5 years and is definitely still ongoing). There will be several other resources out there on the internet describing \"optimal workflows\", and these are definitely worth a read too (although a quick google found surprisingly few with the level of detail needed for a beginner). The key is figuring out a workflow that works best for *you*. That may be similar to mine, or it may not be. \n\nIf you decide to keep reading (perhaps because you too suffer from messy-project-syndrome and want some relief), by the end of this post you will know far too much about me and how I spend my time. As you will discover, I am particularly thorough when I clean data, and can spend hours simply making sure that I know what is in the data and moulding it so that it exactly adheres precisely to the format that I consider \"clean\". \n\nIn this post I will describe my thought process as I download, clean and prepare for analysis the data from the 2016 **American Time Use Survey (ATUS)**. I have written my process in sufficient detail such that you can follow along if you'd like to.\n\nThe [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) is a yearly survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As with all surveys, it is probably good practice to first get an idea of what kind of population its respondents are supposed to represent. According to their website, the survey is sent to a randomly selected individual from each household in a set of eligible households chosen so as to represent a range of demographic characteristics. The set of eligible households consist of those who have completed their final month of the [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm) (a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\nThis survey data has been featured heavily on Nathan Yau's blog, [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/tag/time-use/), which is where I became aware of it (thanks Nathan!).\n\n\nThe ATUS data can be downloaded from the [American Time Use Survey Extract Builder](https://www.atusdata.org/atus/) which is maintained by the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTo actually obtain the data, you need to click on \"Build an Extract\" in the left-hand \"Data\" menu item (or click on \"Get Data\" inside the \"Create an Extract\" box). While I was initially confused about what to do once I got to the page with the drop-down menus asking me to \"Select Variables\", I decided to just go crazy and start clicking. I soon discovered that an \"extract\" refers to the subset of the data corresponding to whichever variables I like. Once inside each of these drop-down menu entries I needed to click on the yellow plus symbols under \"cart\" to add the variables to my extract.\n\nAfter selecting the variables I wanted, I clicked on \"Select Samples\" and selected only the year 2016. I then went to my cart and clicked on \"Create Data Extract\" and I was taken to a page where I had to choose my data format. I **changed the data format to .csv** and submitted my extract by clicking on \"Submit Extract\". Note that you need to create an account to download your selected data, but this only takes a second. Once your data has been created (they will email you when it is ready; this should only take about a minute), you can refresh the page and download the CSV data file!\n\nIt is also a good idea to download the basic codebook by right clicking on the link and selecting \"Save Link As\" (which will tell us what each of the variables mean). I saved the file as a .txt file rather than whatever .cbk (the default) is.\n\nIn case you're interested, the variables I selected are listed at the [end of this post](#variables).\n\n# Setting up the project directory\n\nNow that I have successfully downloaded the data (a file called `atus_00002.csv.gz`), I am ready to set up my project directory. This involved a few quick steps.\n\n1. I made a directory called `ATUS/`. This is where my project is going to live.\n\n1. Within `ATUS/`, I made two empty sub-directories `R/` and `data/` \n\n1. In the `R/` sub-directory I make two empty .R files called `load.R` and `clean.R`. \n\n1. I then move the downloaded data and codebook files into `data/`\n\nIf you're following along, my working directory now looks like this:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ndata/\n  atus_00002.csv.gz\n  atus_00002.txt\nR/\n  clean.R\n  load.R\n```\n\nIt should be pretty obvious what `load.R` and `clean.R` are going to be for: they will be for loading the data and then cleaning the data (shocking, I know!). \n\nWhile I will later start conducting my analysis in an `eda.Rmd` file, I usually don't want to do the initial data cleaning in this file as it can be long and annoying to have to scroll past. Instead, I prefer to have separate scripts containing functions for loading and cleaning the data which I will later call in my `eda.Rmd` file.\n\n\n# Loading the data: `load.R`\n\nTime to start work in the `load.R` file! The first thing I want to do is attempt to load in the data. Sometimes this is painless and easy, and sometimes this is a nightmare (prompting a session of frantic googling on how to load obscure data types into R).\n\nThe first lines of code I write in `load.R` is as follows:\n\n```{r echo = TRUE}\n# open zipped file for reading\nunz <- gzfile(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")\n# load in the data\ntime_use_orig <- read.csv(unz)\n```\n\nwhen I run it in the console, I am pleasantly surprised to find that it works without any issue.\n\nI then take my first look at the data in the console using the `dim()` command to identify the dimension of the data and the `head()` command to view the first 6 rows. \n\n```{r}\ndim(time_use_orig)\nhead(time_use_orig)\n```\n\nIt is pretty clear that everything is coded numerically and the variable names are fairly meaningless to a human. Fortunately, the codebook explains all. I spend some time browsing it.\n\n\n\n## The `loadData()` function\n\nTo make things simple in the long-run, I turn the above commands into a reusable function called `loadData()`. This function will have only one argument that specifies the path of the data in the local directory (relative to the `load.R` file). I usually set the default path to be the actual path for my setup. \n\n```{r}\n# a function to load in the data\nloadData <- function(path_to_data = \"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\") {\n  # open zipped file for reading\n  unz <- gzfile(path_to_data)\n  # load in the data\n  read.csv(unz)\n}\n```\n\nTo test my function, I simply run in my console by typing\n\n```{r}\ntime_use_orig <- loadData()\n```\n\nand look at the output of `head(time_use_orig)`.\n\nObviously such a function is a bit redundant in this setting: it is just as easy to write `read.csv(gzfile(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\"))` in my eventual `eda.Rmd` file as it is to write `loadData(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")`. The reason I keep the `load.R` file in this case is because this is just my default workflow. I always load in my data using a function called `loadData`. In some situations, there are many, many things that need to be done in order to load the data, meaning that my `loadData` function can be fairly complicated. For example, sometimes column names need to be read in separately and then attached to the data, and sometimes I need to play with the format of the data to get R to play nice. \n\n# Cleaning the data: `clean.R`\n\nNext, I need to make some decisions about whether to keep the data in its raw, ugly form, or to spend some time making my life easier in the long-run by converting the column names to human-readable versions and converting the numeric codes for each variable to text descriptive characters or factors.\n\nI also need to ensure that missing values are coded as `NA`s and that the class of each variable is what I would expect. For example, when I looked at the `head()` of the data above, I noticed that the `CASEID` variable is printed as a numeric in scientific notation, which is not ideal. IDs should probably be factors or characters (I go back and forth a lot on which I prefer)!\n\nIn `clean.R` I start work on a function called `cleanData()`. Like `loadData()`, the function `cleanData()` is always a part of my workflow. \n\nWhen I eventually start the `eda.Rmd` file, I will load and clean the data like this:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\n# define the loadData() function\nsource(\"load.R\")\n# define the cleanData() function\nsource(\"clean.R\")\n\n# load the raw data\ntime_use_orig <- loadData(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")\n# clean the data\ntime_use <- cleanData(time_use_orig)\n```\n\n\n## The `cleanData()` function\n\nThe `cleanData()` function will actually call three separate functions, each performing a single task. These functions are\n\n- `renameColumns()`: an optional part of my workflow that changes the column names of each of my columns so that I can actually understand what they mean.\n\n- `convertMissing()`: a function which converts missing values to `NA`\n\n- `convertClass`: a function which sets factor variables to factors, sets character variables to characters, etc\n\n### Making columns human-readable: `renameColumns()`\n\nI hate reading column names that are all-caps, use ridiculous abbreviations and generally don't adhere to my definition of \"aesthetically pleasing\". Thus, whenever possible, I tend to convert my column names to human-readable versions. This is fairly tedious whenever the data has more than around 10 variables or so, but the process itself of renaming the variables is a very effective way of ensuring that you have a good idea of which variables are even in the data. \n\nA word of caution: it is extremely important to check that you have correctly renamed the variables, since it is very easy to assign the wrong name to a variable, resulting in misleading conclusions.\n\nObviously this step is not practical if you have more than 100 or so variables (although I once did it with a dataset that had around 300 variables!). In addition, if I will at some point need to present the data to people who are very familiar with the original variable names, I won't do any renaming either.\n\nIn this case, however, I have no particular allegiance to the original variable names and I want to make it as clear as possible (to myself, at least) what they mean. \n\nTo change the variable names, the `renameColumns()` function will leverage the `dplyr` function, `select()`. Note that I also drop a few variables at this stage that I decided weren't interesting.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nrenameColumns <- function(data) {\n  data <- data %>% select(id = CASEID,\n                          year = YEAR,\n                          # number of attempted contacts\n                          num_contacts = NUMCONTACTS_CPS8,\n                          state = STATEFIP,\n                          household_size = HH_SIZE,\n                          family_income = FAMINCOME,\n                          num_children = HH_NUMKIDS,\n                          num_adults = HH_NUMADULTS,\n                          age = AGE,\n                          sex = SEX,\n                          race = RACE,\n                          marital_status = MARST,\n                          education_level = EDUC,\n                          education_years = EDUCYRS,\n                          employment_status = EMPSTAT,\n                          occupation_category = OCC2,\n                          occupation_industry = IND2,\n                          employed_full_time = FULLPART,\n                          hours_usually_worked = UHRSWORKT,\n                          weekly_earning = EARNWEEK,\n                          paid_hourly = PAIDHOUR,\n                          hourly_wage = HOURWAGE,\n                          hours_worked_hourly_rate = HRSATRATE,\n                          time_spent_caring_household = ACT_CAREHH,\n                          time_spent_caring_non_household = ACT_CARENHH,\n                          time_spent_education = ACT_EDUC,\n                          time_spent_eating = ACT_FOOD,\n                          time_spent_gov = ACT_GOVSERV,\n                          time_spent_household_activities = ACT_HHACT,\n                          time_spent_household_services = ACT_HHSERV,\n                          time_spent_personal_care = ACT_PCARE,\n                          time_spent_phone = ACT_PHONE,\n                          time_spent_personal_care_services = ACT_PROFSERV,\n                          time_spent_shopping = ACT_PURCH,\n                          time_spent_religion = ACT_RELIG,\n                          time_spent_leisure = ACT_SOCIAL,\n                          time_spent_sports = ACT_SPORTS,\n                          time_spent_travelling = ACT_TRAVEL,\n                          time_spent_volunteer = ACT_VOL,\n                          time_spent_working = ACT_WORK)\n  return(data)\n}\n```\n\nI then test the function out by writing\n\n```{r}\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n```\n\nin the console, and looking at the output of `head(time_use)`.\n\nNow, I am fully aware that this function I have just written is not generalizable to alternate subsets of the data variables. This will be one of only two places where I will need to change things if I want to re-run the analysis on a different subset of variables (the second place will be when I explicitly convert numeric variables to their character counterparts). I'm facing a trade-off between generalizability of my pipeline and having human-readable data. If I were intending to repeat this analysis on different variables, I would either remove the part of the workflow where I rename the variables (as well as the part where I convert numeric variables to meaningful factors later on), or I would set the variable names as an argument in the `renameColumns()` function (but sadly, `select()` doesn't play very nicely with variables read in as character strings, so I try to avoid this). \n\n### Recoding missing values as `NA`: `convertMissing()`\n\nIf you took a look at the codebook, you will have noticed that there are many different ways to say that data is missing. This can be very problematic.\n\nThe most common way to code missingness in this data is to code it as `99` `999`, `9999`, etc (depending on whether the entries for the variable are two, three, four or more digit numbers, respectively). These entries are referred to in the codebook as `NIU (Not in universe)`. Other types of missing values are recorded such as `996` corresponding to `Refused`, `997` corresponding to `Don't know` and `998` corresponding to `Blank`.\n\nI now need to decide what to convert to `NA`, keeping in mind that I need to be particularly careful for the variables with many different types of missingness (such as people who refused to answer, didn't know or simply left the entry blank). I decide to take a look to see how widespread these types of missingness are by running the following code in the console:\n\n```{r}\n# identify how many times informative missingness occurs for each variable\ninformative_missing <- sapply(time_use, \n                              function(x) sum(x %in% c(996, 997, 998)))\n# print out only the non-zero values\ninformative_missing[informative_missing != 0]\n```\n\nSince these types of missingness are extremely rare, I decide to simply lump them in with all of the other `NA` values.\n\n\n\nNext, I want to identify which variables have missing values coded as a varying number of 9s. Since the missing values are always supposed to correspond to the maximum, I printed out the maximum of each variable.\n\n```{r}\n# print out the maximum of each column\nsapply(time_use, max)\n```\n\nI notice here that there are several variables with missing values as their maxima such as `occupation_industry` with a maximum of `9999`, and `hourly_wage` with a maximum of `999.99`. Since I don't really want to manually convert these missing values to `NA`, I decide to automate it using the `mutate_if()` function from the `dplyr` package. First I write a few helper functions in the `clean.R` file for calculating the maximum of a vector and for identifying specific values in a vector.\n\n```{r}\n# Helper function for identifying missing values equal to 99, 999, etc\nequalFun <- function(x, value) {\n  x == value\n}\n\n# Helper function for identifying if the max of a variable is equal to 99, ...\nmaxFun <- function(x, value) {\n  max(x, na.rm = T) == value\n}\n```\n\nThe first argument of `mutate_if()` is a function which returns a Boolean value specifying which columns to select. The second argument is wrapped in `funs()` and itself is a function which specifies what to do to each column. `if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .)` can be read aloud as \"If the value is equal to 99, convert it to a `NA` of integer type, otherwise do nothing\" (the `.` serves as a placeholder for the data, like `x` in `function(x)`).\n\n```{r}\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .)))\n  return(data)    \n}\n```\n\nIt took some playing around with running the body of the function in the console (with `data` defined as `time_use`) to get it to run without errors (I was getting errors to do with `NA` values and realized that I needed to add `na.rm = T` in the `maxFun()` function). \n\nOnce the body runs in the console, I then check to make sure that the complete function worked as expected by running it in the console and checking out the summary of the output.\n\n```{r}\n# convert the missing values to NAs\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n# check out the summary\nsummary(time_use)\n```\n\nScrolling through the summary, I notice a few peculiarities. In particular, there are several variables that have stupidly large values. For example the maximum value for `hours_usually_worked` is `9995` (this didn't appear in the codebook!). I decided to look at a histogram of this variable to see how typical this value is. I ran the following code in the console:\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n```\n\nFrom the histogram, it is fairly clear that there is an additional type of missing value (405 samples have a value of `9995`) that was not mentioned in the documentation. I then go back and update my `convertMissing()` function to include this extra missing value.\n\n```{r}\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9995 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9995), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9995), NA_integer_, .))) \n  return(data)    \n}\n```\n\nNext, I ran the `convertMissing()` function again the data and re-made the histogram to make sure that everything was going smoothly. \n\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\n# re-run the renameColumns() function\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n# convert missing values to NA\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n# re-make the histogram\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n```\n\nNow that that was sorted out, it occurred to me that I wasn't sure what kind of scale the `time_spent` variables were on (is it hours spent in the last week? In the last month? The last year? Perhaps it is minutes spent over the last day? It probably should have occurred to me to ask this earlier, but it didn't. Whatever... I'm asking it now! After spending some time perusing the internet for a while, I found [this table](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t01.htm) which summarised the average hours spend *per day* on a range of activities. For example, it said that on average, people spend 9.58 hours per day on \"personal care activities\". The histogram below shows the distribution of values for the `time_spent_personal_care`.\n\n```{r fig.align = \"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = time_spent_personal_care))\n```\n\nThe mean value in the data is 580, which when divided by 60 gives 9.6. From this \"evidence\" I conclude that what the data contains is the **number of minutes spent per day**. Whether this is averaged over a week, or is based on one particular day, I honestly don't know. But for my purposes, I'll just take each value as the number of minutes spent on the activity on a \"typical\" day.\n\n\n### Ensuring each variable has the correct class: `convertClass()`\n\nThe final cleaning task involves converting categorical values to have a categorical variable class (such as a factor), and other things along these lines involving variable classes.\n\nRecall that the person ID variable, `CASEID`, is currently coded as a numeric (which is printed in scientific notation). In general, it is good practice to code IDs as factors (or characters). \n\nThere are also many other variables that should be coded as factors: state, sex, race, marital_status, education_level, family_income, employment_status, occupation_category, and occupation_industry.\n\nNow begins the part of my cleaning process that often takes the longest: I am going to convert each of these numeric variables not only to factors, but to *meaningful* factors. I don't want to make plots for genders 1 and 2, or for states 42 and 28; I want to make plots for males and females and for states Pennsylvania and Mississippi. \n\nFirst, for each variable I need to define a data frame that stores the conversion from number to meaningful category. Fortunately, this information was found in the codebook, and I can copy and paste these code conversions into separate .txt files and save them in the `data/` folder: `states.txt`, `occupation_industry.txt`, `occupation_category.txt`, etc. I can then read them into R as tab-delimited text files.\n\n\nIn case you're interested, after copying the subsets of the codebook, my project directory now looks like this:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ndata/\n  atus_00002.csv.gz\n  atus_00002.txt\n  education_level.txt\n  employment_status.txt\n  family_income.txt\n  marital_status.txt\n  occupation_category.txt\n  occupation_industry.txt\n  race.txt\n  sex.txt\n  state.txt\nR/\n  clean.R\n  load.R\n```\n\nI now start work on a `convertClass()` function which will be the third component of my `cleanData()` function. The first thing I do in `convertClass()` is convert the `id` variable to a factor. I then loop through each of the other factor variables to read in the code conversions from the .txt files, join the meaningful factors onto the original data frame using `left_join()` and remove the numeric version of the variable. The function that I wrote is presented below. I spent a while playing around in the console with various versions of the function below (always running code from the .R file rather than typing directly in the console itself).\n\n```{r}\nconvertClass <- function(data, path_to_codes = \"data/\") {\n  # convert id to a factor\n  data <- data %>% mutate(id = as.factor(id))\n  # loop through each of the factor variables and convert to meaningful\n  # factor then add to data frame\n  for (variable in c(\"state\", \"occupation_industry\", \"occupation_category\",\n                       \"education_level\", \"race\", \"marital_status\", \"sex\",\n                       \"employment_status\", \"family_income\")) {\n    # identify the path to the code file\n    path <- paste0(path_to_codes, variable, \".txt\")\n    # read in the code file\n    codes <- read.table(path, sep = \"\\t\")\n    # remove the second column (the entries are separated by two \\t's)\n    codes <- codes[, -2]\n    # convert the column names\n    colnames(codes) <- c(variable, paste0(variable, \"_name\"))\n    # add the code to the original data frame\n    data <- left_join(data, codes, by = variable)\n    # remove old variable and replace with new variable\n    data[, variable] <- data[, paste0(variable, \"_name\")]\n    data <- data[, !(colnames(data) %in% paste0(variable, \"_name\"))]\n  }\n  return(data)\n}\n```\n\nAfter I was done, I tested out that the `convertClass()` did what I hoped by running the following code in the console:\n\n```{r}\n# run the convertClass() function\ntime_use <- convertClass(time_use)\n# compare the original variables with the meaningful versions\nhead(time_use)\n```\n\nEverything looks good! I add `renameColumns()`, `convertMissing()` and `convertClass()` to the `cleanData()` function. I'm finally done with the cleaning component of my workflow. I may have to come back and add additional steps as I make unpleasant discoveries in my analysis, but for now, I can move on.\n\nBelow I print my final `clean.R` file\n\n\n```{r}\n# filename: clean.R\n\n# Main function for data cleaning stage\ncleanData <- function(data) {\n  #

Apparently we are all just supposed to \"figure it out for ourselves\". For most of us, when we start our first few analysis projects, we basically have no idea how we are going to structure all of our files, or even what files we will need to make. As we try more and more things in our analysis (perhaps generating a large number of unnecessary files called `analysis2.R`, `next-analysis.R`, `analysis-writeup.Rmd`, `data_clean.csv`, `regression_results.csv` and `data_all.csv` along the way), we find that our project folder gets jumbled and confusing. The frustration when we come back to the project 6 months later and can't remember which file contained the code that lead to the final conclusions is all too real.\n\nThis is why I have decided to describe in (possibly too much) detail the data cleaning workflow that I have somehow ended up with. I find this workflow to be particularly useful when dealing with messy (and possibly large) datasets that need several cleaning steps. Note that I did not develop this workflow in conjunction with any resources, I simply figured out what worked best for me via trial-and-error (a process which took 5 years and is definitely still ongoing). There will be several other resources out there on the internet describing \"optimal workflows\", and these are definitely worth a read too (although a quick google found surprisingly few with the level of detail needed for a beginner). The key is figuring out a workflow that works best for *you*. That may be similar to mine, or it may not be. \n\nIf you decide to keep reading (perhaps because you too suffer from messy-project-syndrome and want some relief), by the end of this post you will know far too much about me and how I spend my time. As you will discover, I am particularly thorough when I clean data, and can spend hours simply making sure that I know what is in the data and moulding it so that it exactly adheres precisely to the format that I consider \"clean\". \n\nIn this post I will describe my thought process as I download, clean and prepare for analysis the data from the 2016 **American Time Use Survey (ATUS)**. I have written my process in sufficient detail such that you can follow along if you'd like to.\n\nThe [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) is a yearly survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As with all surveys, it is probably good practice to first get an idea of what kind of population its respondents are supposed to represent. According to their website, the survey is sent to a randomly selected individual from each household in a set of eligible households chosen so as to represent a range of demographic characteristics. The set of eligible households consist of those who have completed their final month of the [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm) (a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\nThis survey data has been featured heavily on Nathan Yau's blog, [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/tag/time-use/), which is where I became aware of it (thanks Nathan!).\n\n# Obtaining the data from the website\n\nThe ATUS data can be downloaded from the [American Time Use Survey Extract Builder](https://www.atusdata.org/atus/) which is maintained by the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTo actually obtain the data, you need to click on \"Build an Extract\" in the left-hand \"Data\" menu item (or click on \"Get Data\" inside the \"Create an Extract\" box). While I was initially confused about what to do once I got to the page with the drop-down menus asking me to \"Select Variables\", I decided to just go crazy and start clicking. I soon discovered that an \"extract\" refers to the subset of the data corresponding to whichever variables I like. Once inside each of these drop-down menu entries I needed to click on the yellow plus symbols under \"cart\" to add the variables to my extract.\n\nAfter selecting the variables I wanted, I clicked on \"Select Samples\" and selected only the year 2016. I then went to my cart and clicked on \"Create Data Extract\" and I was taken to a page where I had to choose my data format. I **changed the data format to .csv** and submitted my extract by clicking on \"Submit Extract\". Note that you need to create an account to download your selected data, but this only takes a second. Once your data has been created (they will email you when it is ready; this should only take about a minute), you can refresh the page and download the CSV data file!\n\nIt is also a good idea to download the basic codebook by right clicking on the link and selecting \"Save Link As\" (which will tell us what each of the variables mean). I saved the file as a .txt file rather than whatever .cbk (the default) is.\n\nIn case you're interested, the variables I selected are listed at the [end of this post](#variables).\n\n# Setting up the project directory\n\nNow that I have successfully downloaded the data (a file called `atus_00002.csv.gz`), I am ready to set up my project directory. This involved a few quick steps.\n\n1. I made a directory called `ATUS/`. This is where my project is going to live.\n\n1. Within `ATUS/`, I made two empty sub-directories `R/` and `data/` \n\n1. In the `R/` sub-directory I make two empty .R files called `load.R` and `clean.R`. \n\n1. I then move the downloaded data and codebook files into `data/`\n\nIf you're following along, my working directory now looks like this:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ndata/\n  atus_00002.csv.gz\n  atus_00002.txt\nR/\n  clean.R\n  load.R\n```\n\nIt should be pretty obvious what `load.R` and `clean.R` are going to be for: they will be for loading the data and then cleaning the data (shocking, I know!). \n\nWhile I will later start conducting my analysis in an `eda.Rmd` file, I usually don't want to do the initial data cleaning in this file as it can be long and annoying to have to scroll past. Instead, I prefer to have separate scripts containing functions for loading and cleaning the data which I will later call in my `eda.Rmd` file.\n\n\n# Loading the data: `load.R`\n\nTime to start work in the `load.R` file! The first thing I want to do is attempt to load in the data. Sometimes this is painless and easy, and sometimes this is a nightmare (prompting a session of frantic googling on how to load obscure data types into R).\n\nThe first lines of code I write in `load.R` is as follows:\n\n```{r echo = TRUE}\n# open zipped file for reading\nunz <- gzfile(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")\n# load in the data\ntime_use_orig <- read.csv(unz)\n```\n\nwhen I run it in the console, I am pleasantly surprised to find that it works without any issue.\n\nI then take my first look at the data in the console using the `dim()` command to identify the dimension of the data and the `head()` command to view the first 6 rows. \n\n```{r}\ndim(time_use_orig)\nhead(time_use_orig)\n```\n\nIt is pretty clear that everything is coded numerically and the variable names are fairly meaningless to a human. Fortunately, the codebook explains all. I spend some time browsing it.\n\n\n\n## The `loadData()` function\n\nTo make things simple in the long-run, I turn the above commands into a reusable function called `loadData()`. This function will have only one argument that specifies the path of the data in the local directory (relative to the `load.R` file). I usually set the default path to be the actual path for my setup. \n\n```{r}\n# a function to load in the data\nloadData <- function(path_to_data = \"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\") {\n  # open zipped file for reading\n  unz <- gzfile(path_to_data)\n  # load in the data\n  read.csv(unz)\n}\n```\n\nTo test my function, I simply run in my console by typing\n\n```{r}\ntime_use_orig <- loadData()\n```\n\nand look at the output of `head(time_use_orig)`.\n\nObviously such a function is a bit redundant in this setting: it is just as easy to write `read.csv(gzfile(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\"))` in my eventual `eda.Rmd` file as it is to write `loadData(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")`. The reason I keep the `load.R` file in this case is because this is just my default workflow. I always load in my data using a function called `loadData`. In some situations, there are many, many things that need to be done in order to load the data, meaning that my `loadData` function can be fairly complicated. For example, sometimes column names need to be read in separately and then attached to the data, and sometimes I need to play with the format of the data to get R to play nice. \n\n# Cleaning the data: `clean.R`\n\nNext, I need to make some decisions about whether to keep the data in its raw, ugly form, or to spend some time making my life easier in the long-run by converting the column names to human-readable versions and converting the numeric codes for each variable to text descriptive characters or factors.\n\nI also need to ensure that missing values are coded as `NA`s and that the class of each variable is what I would expect. For example, when I looked at the `head()` of the data above, I noticed that the `CASEID` variable is printed as a numeric in scientific notation, which is not ideal. IDs should probably be factors or characters (I go back and forth a lot on which I prefer)!\n\nIn `clean.R` I start work on a function called `cleanData()`. Like `loadData()`, the function `cleanData()` is always a part of my workflow. \n\nWhen I eventually start the `eda.Rmd` file, I will load and clean the data like this:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\n# define the loadData() function\nsource(\"load.R\")\n# define the cleanData() function\nsource(\"clean.R\")\n\n# load the raw data\ntime_use_orig <- loadData(\"data/atus_00002.csv.gz\")\n# clean the data\ntime_use <- cleanData(time_use_orig)\n```\n\n\n## The `cleanData()` function\n\nThe `cleanData()` function will actually call three separate functions, each performing a single task. These functions are\n\n- `renameColumns()`: an optional part of my workflow that changes the column names of each of my columns so that I can actually understand what they mean.\n\n- `convertMissing()`: a function which converts missing values to `NA`\n\n- `convertClass`: a function which sets factor variables to factors, sets character variables to characters, etc\n\n### Making columns human-readable: `renameColumns()`\n\nI hate reading column names that are all-caps, use ridiculous abbreviations and generally don't adhere to my definition of \"aesthetically pleasing\". Thus, whenever possible, I tend to convert my column names to human-readable versions. This is fairly tedious whenever the data has more than around 10 variables or so, but the process itself of renaming the variables is a very effective way of ensuring that you have a good idea of which variables are even in the data. \n\nA word of caution: it is extremely important to check that you have correctly renamed the variables, since it is very easy to assign the wrong name to a variable, resulting in misleading conclusions.\n\nObviously this step is not practical if you have more than 100 or so variables (although I once did it with a dataset that had around 300 variables!). In addition, if I will at some point need to present the data to people who are very familiar with the original variable names, I won't do any renaming either.\n\nIn this case, however, I have no particular allegiance to the original variable names and I want to make it as clear as possible (to myself, at least) what they mean. \n\nTo change the variable names, the `renameColumns()` function will leverage the `dplyr` function, `select()`. Note that I also drop a few variables at this stage that I decided weren't interesting.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nrenameColumns <- function(data) {\n  data <- data %>% select(id = CASEID,\n                          year = YEAR,\n                          # number of attempted contacts\n                          num_contacts = NUMCONTACTS_CPS8,\n                          state = STATEFIP,\n                          household_size = HH_SIZE,\n                          family_income = FAMINCOME,\n                          num_children = HH_NUMKIDS,\n                          num_adults = HH_NUMADULTS,\n                          age = AGE,\n                          sex = SEX,\n                          race = RACE,\n                          marital_status = MARST,\n                          education_level = EDUC,\n                          education_years = EDUCYRS,\n                          employment_status = EMPSTAT,\n                          occupation_category = OCC2,\n                          occupation_industry = IND2,\n                          employed_full_time = FULLPART,\n                          hours_usually_worked = UHRSWORKT,\n                          weekly_earning = EARNWEEK,\n                          paid_hourly = PAIDHOUR,\n                          hourly_wage = HOURWAGE,\n                          hours_worked_hourly_rate = HRSATRATE,\n                          time_spent_caring_household = ACT_CAREHH,\n                          time_spent_caring_non_household = ACT_CARENHH,\n                          time_spent_education = ACT_EDUC,\n                          time_spent_eating = ACT_FOOD,\n                          time_spent_gov = ACT_GOVSERV,\n                          time_spent_household_activities = ACT_HHACT,\n                          time_spent_household_services = ACT_HHSERV,\n                          time_spent_personal_care = ACT_PCARE,\n                          time_spent_phone = ACT_PHONE,\n                          time_spent_personal_care_services = ACT_PROFSERV,\n                          time_spent_shopping = ACT_PURCH,\n                          time_spent_religion = ACT_RELIG,\n                          time_spent_leisure = ACT_SOCIAL,\n                          time_spent_sports = ACT_SPORTS,\n                          time_spent_travelling = ACT_TRAVEL,\n                          time_spent_volunteer = ACT_VOL,\n                          time_spent_working = ACT_WORK)\n  return(data)\n}\n```\n\nI then test the function out by writing\n\n```{r}\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n```\n\nin the console, and looking at the output of `head(time_use)`.\n\nNow, I am fully aware that this function I have just written is not generalizable to alternate subsets of the data variables. This will be one of only two places where I will need to change things if I want to re-run the analysis on a different subset of variables (the second place will be when I explicitly convert numeric variables to their character counterparts). I'm facing a trade-off between generalizability of my pipeline and having human-readable data. If I were intending to repeat this analysis on different variables, I would either remove the part of the workflow where I rename the variables (as well as the part where I convert numeric variables to meaningful factors later on), or I would set the variable names as an argument in the `renameColumns()` function (but sadly, `select()` doesn't play very nicely with variables read in as character strings, so I try to avoid this). \n\n### Recoding missing values as `NA`: `convertMissing()`\n\nIf you took a look at the codebook, you will have noticed that there are many different ways to say that data is missing. This can be very problematic.\n\nThe most common way to code missingness in this data is to code it as `99` `999`, `9999`, etc (depending on whether the entries for the variable are two, three, four or more digit numbers, respectively). These entries are referred to in the codebook as `NIU (Not in universe)`. Other types of missing values are recorded such as `996` corresponding to `Refused`, `997` corresponding to `Don't know` and `998` corresponding to `Blank`.\n\nI now need to decide what to convert to `NA`, keeping in mind that I need to be particularly careful for the variables with many different types of missingness (such as people who refused to answer, didn't know or simply left the entry blank). I decide to take a look to see how widespread these types of missingness are by running the following code in the console:\n\n```{r}\n# identify how many times informative missingness occurs for each variable\ninformative_missing <- sapply(time_use, \n                              function(x) sum(x %in% c(996, 997, 998)))\n# print out only the non-zero values\ninformative_missing[informative_missing != 0]\n```\n\nSince these types of missingness are extremely rare, I decide to simply lump them in with all of the other `NA` values.\n\n\n\nNext, I want to identify which variables have missing values coded as a varying number of 9s. Since the missing values are always supposed to correspond to the maximum, I printed out the maximum of each variable.\n\n```{r}\n# print out the maximum of each column\nsapply(time_use, max)\n```\n\nI notice here that there are several variables with missing values as their maxima such as `occupation_industry` with a maximum of `9999`, and `hourly_wage` with a maximum of `999.99`. Since I don't really want to manually convert these missing values to `NA`, I decide to automate it using the `mutate_if()` function from the `dplyr` package. First I write a few helper functions in the `clean.R` file for calculating the maximum of a vector and for identifying specific values in a vector.\n\n```{r}\n# Helper function for identifying missing values equal to 99, 999, etc\nequalFun <- function(x, value) {\n  x == value\n}\n\n# Helper function for identifying if the max of a variable is equal to 99, ...\nmaxFun <- function(x, value) {\n  max(x, na.rm = T) == value\n}\n```\n\nThe first argument of `mutate_if()` is a function which returns a Boolean value specifying which columns to select. The second argument is wrapped in `funs()` and itself is a function which specifies what to do to each column. `if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .)` can be read aloud as \"If the value is equal to 99, convert it to a `NA` of integer type, otherwise do nothing\" (the `.` serves as a placeholder for the data, like `x` in `function(x)`).\n\n```{r}\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .)))\n  return(data)    \n}\n```\n\nIt took some playing around with running the body of the function in the console (with `data` defined as `time_use`) to get it to run without errors (I was getting errors to do with `NA` values and realized that I needed to add `na.rm = T` in the `maxFun()` function). \n\nOnce the body runs in the console, I then check to make sure that the complete function worked as expected by running it in the console and checking out the summary of the output.\n\n```{r}\n# convert the missing values to NAs\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n# check out the summary\nsummary(time_use)\n```\n\nScrolling through the summary, I notice a few peculiarities. In particular, there are several variables that have stupidly large values. For example the maximum value for `hours_usually_worked` is `9995` (this didn't appear in the codebook!). I decided to look at a histogram of this variable to see how typical this value is. I ran the following code in the console:\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n```\n\nFrom the histogram, it is fairly clear that there is an additional type of missing value (405 samples have a value of `9995`) that was not mentioned in the documentation. I then go back and update my `convertMissing()` function to include this extra missing value.\n\n```{r}\nconvertMissing <- function(data) {\n  # convert missing values to NA\n  data <- data %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9999 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9999), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9999), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 99999.99 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 99999.99), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 99999.99), NA_real_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 998 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 998), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 998), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 997 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 997), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 997), NA_integer_, .))) %>%\n    # mutate all missing values coded as 9995 to NA\n    mutate_if(function(x) maxFun(x, 9995), \n              funs(if_else(equalFun(., 9995), NA_integer_, .))) \n  return(data)    \n}\n```\n\nNext, I ran the `convertMissing()` function again the data and re-made the histogram to make sure that everything was going smoothly. \n\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\n# re-run the renameColumns() function\ntime_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)\n# convert missing values to NA\ntime_use <- convertMissing(time_use)\n# re-make the histogram\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))\n```\n\nNow that that was sorted out, it occurred to me that I wasn't sure what kind of scale the `time_spent` variables were on (is it hours spent in the last week? In the last month? The last year? Perhaps it is minutes spent over the last day? It probably should have occurred to me to ask this earlier, but it didn't. Whatever... I'm asking it now! After spending some time perusing the internet for a while, I found [this table](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t01.htm) which summarised the average hours spend *per day* on a range of activities. For example, it said that on average, people spend 9.58 hours per day on \"personal care activities\". The histogram below shows the distribution of values for the `time_spent_personal_care`.\n\n```{r fig.align = \"center\", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}\nggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = time_spent_personal_care))\n```\n\nThe mean value in the data is 580, which when divided by 60 gives 9.6. From this \"evidence\" I conclude that what the data contains is the **number of minutes spent per day**. Whether this is averaged over a week, or is based on one particular day, I honestly don't know. But for my purposes, I'll just take each value as the number of minutes spent on the activity on a \"typical\" day.\n\n\n### Ensuring each variable has the correct class: `convertClass()`\n\nThe final cleaning task involves converting categorical values to have a categorical variable class (such as a factor), and other things along these lines involving variable classes.\n\nRecall that the person ID variable, `CASEID`, is currently coded as a numeric (which is printed in scientific notation). In general, it is good practice to code IDs as factors (or characters). \n\nThere are also many other variables that should be coded as factors: state, sex, race, marital_status, education_level, family_income, employment_status, occupation_category, and occupation_industry.\n\nNow begins the part of my cleaning process that often takes the longest: I am going to convert each of these numeric variables not only to factors, but to *meaningful* factors. I don't want to make plots for genders 1 and 2, or for states 42 and 28; I want to make plots for males and females and for states Pennsylvania and Mississippi. \n\nFirst, for each variable I need to define a data frame that stores the conversion from number to meaningful category. Fortunately, this information was found in the codebook, and I can copy and paste these code conversions into separate .txt files and save them in the `data/` folder: `states.txt`, `occupation_industry.txt`, `occupation_category.txt`, etc. I can then read them into R as tab-delimited text files.\n\n\nIn case you're interested, after copying the subsets of the codebook, my project directory now looks like this:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ndata/\n  atus_00002.csv.gz\n  atus_00002.txt\n  education_level.txt\n  employment_status.txt\n  family_income.txt\n  marital_status.txt\n  occupation_category.txt\n  occupation_industry.txt\n  race.txt\n  sex.txt\n  state.txt\nR/\n  clean.R\n  load.R\n```\n\nI now start work on a `convertClass()` function which will be the third component of my `cleanData()` function. The first thing I do in `convertClass()` is convert the `id` variable to a factor. I then loop through each of the other factor variables to read in the code conversions from the .txt files, join the meaningful factors onto the original data frame using `left_join()` and remove the numeric version of the variable. The function that I wrote is presented below. I spent a while playing around in the console with various versions of the function below (always running code from the .R file rather than typing directly in the console itself).\n\n```{r}\nconvertClass <- function(data, path_to_codes = \"data/\") {\n  # convert id to a factor\n  data <- data %>% mutate(id = as.factor(id))\n  # loop through each of the factor variables and convert to meaningful\n  # factor then add to data frame\n  for (variable in c(\"state\", \"occupation_industry\", \"occupation_category\",\n                       \"education_level\", \"race\", \"marital_status\", \"sex\",\n                       \"employment_status\", \"family_income\")) {\n    # identify the path to the code file\n    path <- paste0(path_to_codes, variable, \".txt\")\n    # read in the code file\n    codes <- read.table(path, sep = \"\\t\")\n    # remove the second column (the entries are separated by two \\t's)\n    codes <- codes[, -2]\n    # convert the column names\n    colnames(codes) <- c(variable, paste0(variable, \"_name\"))\n    # add the code to the original data frame\n    data <- left_join(data, codes, by = variable)\n    # remove old variable and replace with new variable\n    data[, variable] <- data[, paste0(variable, \"_name\")]\n    data <- data[, !(colnames(data) %in% paste0(variable, \"_name\"))]\n  }\n  return(data)\n}\n```\n\nAfter I was done, I tested out that the `convertClass()` did what I hoped by running the following code in the console:\n\n```{r}\n# run the convertClass() function\ntime_use <- convertClass(time_use)\n# compare the original variables with the meaningful versions\nhead(time_use)\n```\n\nEverything looks good! I add `renameColumns()`, `convertMissing()` and `convertClass()` to the `cleanData()` function. I'm finally done with the cleaning component of my workflow. I may have to come back and add additional steps as I make unpleasant discoveries in my analysis, but for now, I can move on.\n\nBelow I print my final `clean.R` file\n\n\n```{r}\n# filename: clean.R\n\n# Main function for data cleaning stage\ncleanData <- function(data) {\n  #

If I already know the category of questions I'm planning to ask, and, for example, I know that they fall into two groups, then I will probably make two .Rmd files, one for each question.\n\nIf, however, I just want to play around with the data for a while, as is the case here, I will make a .Rmd file called `eda.Rmd` (or something along those lines).\n\nSometimes I end up separating my initial exploration file into several separate files when I start to go down several diverging paths.\n\nRegardless of the analysis I decide to conduct, each of my `.Rmd` files will start with the following code:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsource(\"R/load.R\")\nsource(\"R/clean.R\")\n\n# laod the data\ntime_use_orig <- loadData()\n# clean the data\ntime_use <- cleanData(time_use_orig)\n```\n\n\nThe opportunities for analysis are wide open!\n\n# List of variables downloaded from ATUX-X {#variables}\n\n\n- CASEID (ATUS Case ID)\n- YEAR (Survey year)\n-
