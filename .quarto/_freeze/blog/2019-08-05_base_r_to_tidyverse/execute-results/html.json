Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you're comfortable doing something a certain way, it's hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. As someone first learnt R 10 years ago (long before the tidyverse) I've been there. Five years ago, I was pushed to stick my little toe into the shallow-end of the tidyverse pool by learning ggplot2, and I never went back. \n\nWhile the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (*ggplot2*, *dplyr*, *purrr*, *tidyr*, *readr*, *tibble*), it is also a way of thinking about implementing \"tidy\" data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. From where I float now substantially closer to the deep-end of the tidyverse pool, I would provide the following arguments you as well as to my past self for why it is a good idea to learn the tidyverse:\n\n- Regardless of whether you think the tidyverse or base R is \"better\", it is always a good idea to keep up with what is current. It's so easy to get left behind. What you learn today will most likely be out-of-date in a year, but next year's iteration of what is current will almost certainly be built upon today's iteration. If you make an effort keep up with things as they change, then you can take lots of little easy steps instead of finding yourself needing to take a big difficult jump in a few years.\n\n- Code written in the tidyverse style is much easier to read, and is more consistent than base R (e.g. the first argument of almost every tidyverse function is the data frame on which it acts, which allows us to make heavy use of something called \"piping\"). Base R, on the other hand, has a somewhat inconsistent mish-mash of function and argument styles.\n\n- The humans that make up the tidyverse community are amazing.\n\nMuch of the initial efforts of the tidyverse were the brainchild of Hadley Wickham, but these days there are a huge number of people who contribute to, maintain, and develop the tidyverse. The tidyverse is open-source and collaborative (which means that you - yes *you* - could contribute to it if you wanted to), and is hosted on the tidyverse github: https://github.com/tidyverse.\n\n\nThe goal of this post is to summarise the overall goals of the tidyverse, provide short tutorials on each of the packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together), and to provide links to additional resources for learning them.\n\nFor new tidyverse practitioners, I'd recommend focusing on getting a handle on piping `%>%`, and learning the *dplyr* and *ggplot2* packages (these form part one of this post). Once you feel comfortable with these core aspects of the tidyverse, you can move onto [part two](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/) of this two-part series on the tidyverse to learn about the remaining packages. \n\nIt is important to remember that the tidyverse is constantly evolving. The best ways to keep up to date with the evolving tidyverse ecosystem is (1) to follow the RStudio blog (https://blog.rstudio.com/), and (2) start following R people on twitter. Mara Averick (@dataandme) and Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) are good people to follow. A great resource for learning about the tidyverse in more detail is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.\n\n# Entering the tidyverse\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/tidyverse/tidyverse.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe fundamental object type of the tidyverse is the data frame (which, once you get a little deeper into the tidyverse ecosystem, becomes a \"tibble\" - more on that later in part 2). Thus the starting point for getting comfortable with the tidyverse is to *always store your data as a **data frame*** (rather than as a matrix or as vectors) with informative string-based column names where words are preferably separated by underscores (rather than periods).\n\nThe tidyverse is not simply a set of functions that replace base R functions. The tidyverse represents a way of *thinking* about how you conduct your data analysis:\n\n- Think of your data frame as the universe, and the columns of your data frame as the objects in your universe that you can explore, manipulate and model.\n\n- When coding in *base R*, it is very common to define many intermediate objects and modified versions of the same data frame (or data object). When coding in the *tidyverse*, the key is to **minimize defining new data objects**. Instead, focus on manipulating your current data frame and just printing the output of your manipulations (e.g. a summary or plot). Only create new data objects in your R environment if you will be using both the *original* data object and the *new* data object in your later analyses. \n\nTo load the tidyverse packages, you could install them all individually (once):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# only ever run once to install the individual packages on your system\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\ninstall.packages(\"purrr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tibble\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nand then load them all into your session individually every time:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n```\n:::\n\n\n*or*, you could just install and load the `tidyverse` package, which will do all of the above for you:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# only ever run once to install the tidyverse on your system\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nwhich is much easier.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, we will use the gapminder dataset that can be loaded directly if you're connected to the internet.\n\nMy general workflow involves loading the original data and saving it as an object with a meaningful name and an `_orig` suffix. I then define a copy of the original dataset without the `_orig` suffix. Having an original copy of my data in my environment means that it is easy to check that my manipulations do what I expected. I will make direct data cleaning modifications to the `gapminder` data frame, but will never edit the `gapminder_orig` data frame. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# to download the data directly:\ngapminder_orig <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv\")\n# define a copy of the original dataset that we will clean and play with \ngapminder <- gapminder_orig\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe gapminder dataset has 1704 rows containing information on population, life expectancy and GDP per capita by year and country. \n\nA \"tidy\" data frame is one where every row is a single observational unit (in this case, indexed by country and year), and every column corresponds to a variable that is measured for each observational unit (in this case, for each country and year, a measurement is made for population, continent, life expectancy and GDP). If you'd like to learn more about \"tidy data\", I highly recommend reading [Hadley Wickham's tidy data article](vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(gapminder)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1704    6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(gapminder)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453\n2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530\n3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007\n4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971\n5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811\n6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that you've loaded the tidyverse and the gapminder data, you're are ready to learn about our first tidy analysis tool: the pipe.\n\n# Piping: %>%\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"img/tidyverse/pipe.png\" alt=\"Pipe\" width=\"180\" height=\"200\">\n</p>\n\nPipes are the workhorse of tidy analyses. Piping allows you to chain together many functions, eliminating the need to define multiple intermediate objects to use as the input to subsequent functions. In my eyes, pipes are also the primary reason that tidyverse code is fundamentally easier to read than base R code.\n\nI always read the pipe symbol, `%>%`, in my head as *\"and then\"*. Consider the following code. Try to figure out what the following code will produce (even if you've never seen the `filter` and `select` dplyr functions before - I'll formally introduce these later).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\", year == \"2007\") %>%\n  select(country, lifeExp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nI read this code in my head as: *take the gapminder dataset **and then** filter to the \"Americas\" continents and the year 2007, **and then** select the country and life expectancy variables.*\n\nRunning this code first filters the data frame only to the rows whose `continent` value is \"Americas\" and whose `year` value is \"2007\", and then it shows you the `country` and `lifeExp` columns for those rows. Run it yourself to see.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# take the gapminder dataset\ngapminder %>%\n  # and filter to the rows whose continent is Americas and year is 2007\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\", year == 2007) %>%\n  # show the country and lifeExp values for these rows\n  select(country, lifeExp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               country lifeExp\n1            Argentina  75.320\n2              Bolivia  65.554\n3               Brazil  72.390\n4               Canada  80.653\n5                Chile  78.553\n6             Colombia  72.889\n7           Costa Rica  78.782\n8                 Cuba  78.273\n9   Dominican Republic  72.235\n10             Ecuador  74.994\n11         El Salvador  71.878\n12           Guatemala  70.259\n13               Haiti  60.916\n14            Honduras  70.198\n15             Jamaica  72.567\n16              Mexico  76.195\n17           Nicaragua  72.899\n18              Panama  75.537\n19            Paraguay  71.752\n20                Peru  71.421\n21         Puerto Rico  78.746\n22 Trinidad and Tobago  69.819\n23       United States  78.242\n24             Uruguay  76.384\n25           Venezuela  73.747\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo become a piping expert you'll need to have a firm grasp on what it's actually doing. The pipe uses the object on the left-hand-side of the `%>%` as the *first argument* of the function on the right-hand-side.\n\nFor instance, the un-piped version of\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\", year == 2007)\n```\n:::\n\n\nis \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfilter(gapminder, continent == \"Americas\", year == 2007)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you were determined not to use piping, but you wanted to do many manipulations, your code would very quickly get messy and difficult to read. In the style of base R, the common way of making code more readable is to define intermediate objects. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder_filtered <- filter(gapminder, continent == \"Americas\", year == 2007)\ngapminder_filtered_selected <- select(gapminder_filtered, country, lifeExp)\ngapminder_filtered_selected\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               country lifeExp\n1            Argentina  75.320\n2              Bolivia  65.554\n3               Brazil  72.390\n4               Canada  80.653\n5                Chile  78.553\n6             Colombia  72.889\n7           Costa Rica  78.782\n8                 Cuba  78.273\n9   Dominican Republic  72.235\n10             Ecuador  74.994\n11         El Salvador  71.878\n12           Guatemala  70.259\n13               Haiti  60.916\n14            Honduras  70.198\n15             Jamaica  72.567\n16              Mexico  76.195\n17           Nicaragua  72.899\n18              Panama  75.537\n19            Paraguay  71.752\n20                Peru  71.421\n21         Puerto Rico  78.746\n22 Trinidad and Tobago  69.819\n23       United States  78.242\n24             Uruguay  76.384\n25           Venezuela  73.747\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo me, the piped version is infinitely more clear, and simultaneously got rid of the need to define any intermediate objects that I would have needed to keep track of while reading the code. Once I got more and more comfortable with piping, I started to find that pretty much *all* of my code uses pipes. \n\n\n# Data manipulation: dplyr\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"img/tidyverse/dplyr.png\" alt=\"dplyr\" width=\"180\" height=\"200\">\n</p>\n\n\nThe `filter()` and `select()` functions that I just introduced are examples of data manipulation functions from the dplyr package. \n\nIn the tidyverse, you will almost never use the `[,]` indexing nor the `$` data frame column indexing that are pervasive throughout base R code. Indexing in dplyr is done using `filter()` for rows and `select()` for columns.\n\nYou may have noticed that the variable names `continent`, `year`, `country`, `lifeExp` that were used inside the `filter()` and `select()` functions were **unquoted**. One of the key components of the tidyverse is thinking of your universe as the data frame, and the *columns* of the data frame as variables or objects that you can play with. Just like how you don't need to quote variable names in your environment to play with them, you usually don't need to quote data frame variables (columns) inside tidyverse functions. \n\nLet's contrast our piped dplyr code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# take the gapminder dataset\ngapminder %>%\n  # and filter to the rows whose continent is Americas and year is 2007\n  filter(continent == \"Americas\", year == 2007) %>%\n  # show the country and lifeExp values for these rows\n  select(country, lifeExp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nwith one potential version of equivalent base R code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identify which rows correspond to the Americas and the year 2007\ncontinent_year_index <- which(gapminder[\"continent\"] == \"Americas\" & gapminder[\"year\"] == 2007)\n# pull only those rows and show the country and life expectency columns\ngapminder[continent_year_index, c(\"country\", \"lifeExp\")]\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are a few key differences\n\n- The variable names are quoted in the base R version but not in the dplyr version\n\n- An intermediate row index variable was defined in the base R version but not in the dplyr version\n\n\nThe primary dplyr functions are \n\n## `select`: select columns\n\nThe arguments of the select function specify which data frame variables should be kept. `select()` is like indexing columns by name. You do not need to quote the column names (but you can if you want to).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder %>% \n  select(country, gdpPercap) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output

If you happen to load one of those packages after loading the tidyverse package in your session, you may end up with an error that says `Error in select(., x) : unused argument (x)`. To fix this, you will either need to directly call the `select()` function from the dplyr package using `dplyr::select()` or ensure that you load such packages *before* the tidyverse package (which automatically loads the dplyr package).\n\n## `filter`: filter to rows that satisfy certain conditions\n\nFiltering is a very simple way of only keeping rows that satisfy certain conditions.

Ggplot2 is the data visualization package made by Hadley Wickham, and it is based a set of principles called the *layered grammar of graphics*. The basic idea is that a ggplot graphic layers geometric objects (circles, lines, etc), themes, and scales ontop of data. The form of the geometric object is defined by a `geom_xxx()` function and the properties (position, size, colour) of the geometric objects that based on the data variables are specified by the aesthetic (`aes()`) function (within the `geom_xxx()` function).\n\nThe base layer of any ggplot graph is the empty ggplot layer defined by the `ggplot()` function, which describes the data frame that the plot will be based on. I haven't told ggplot what type of geometric object(s) I want yet, nor how the variables should be mapped to the geometric objects, so I just have a blank plot.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince you now know about pipes, you could pipe in the data that you want to plot.

The error messages have recently been improved to warn you if you are accidentally using a pipe `%>%` to add layers to ggplot objects (which, once you start piping everything into everything, becomes an easy mistake to make).\n\nProbably the most common geom layer is `geom_point`. Inside `geom_point()`, you will specify the aesthetic mappings from the variables to the geometric objects that you want. For instance, if you want to plot a scatterplot with `gdpPercap` on the x-axis and `lifeExp` on the y-axis, then you would add a `geom_point()` geometric layer with relevant aesthetic function: `geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe could also add a smoothed trend line layer on top of the points using `geom_smooth()`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  # add a smoothed LOESS layer\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp), method = \"loess\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that since the aesthetics for `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` are the same, you might want to just specify global aesthetics in the `ggplot()` function, rather than layer-specific aesthetics.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# describe the base ggplot object and tell it what data we are interested in along with the aesthetic mapping\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  # specify global aesthetic mappings\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n  # add a points layer on top\n  geom_point() +\n  # add a smoothed LOESS layer\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe could also combine a *points* geom layer with a *line* geom layer, or any other type of geom layer.

Focus on incorporating piping, dplyr, and ggplot2 into every analysis that you do for the next few months (even if it would initially be quicker to use base R versions). When you feel comfortable with your new skills, move onto [part two](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/) of this blog post and start to incorporate the remaining tidyverse packages (below) into your analytic workflow. Trying to learn everything at once is a sure-fire way to become discouraged. First get comfortable with the main ideas, then learn some more.\n\n\n",
