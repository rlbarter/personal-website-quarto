A few short months ago, we each got out of bed, and unknowingly stepped into a brave new world. A world in which many of the tasks that used to be our day-to-day focus, such as editing, writing, and summarizing documents and code, can now be done by a computer. While we still need to be at the helm, setting the course for these tasks, we no longer need to do all of the minute tasks, like copy-editing, scaling up our code, and summarizing what we did. That's all taken care for us by ChatGPT (and by all of the other software that is looming on the horizon). After writing a rough version of this entire blog post (without worrying about grammar and wording), I used ChatGPT to smooth it out, probably saving me an hour of minute tasks.

Perhaps, like me, when you first started playing with ChatGPT, you felt an eerie sense of dread begin to well up. A dread that said "*This is it. It's here. Holy crap. What is this world that are we about to step into?*".

But the fact of the matter is, it's here. We can't fight it. We can either adapt to a world with it, or we can resist it and get left behind.

As a data science educator, I've been doing a lot of thinking myself about what this means for my own career. And I've tepidly arrived at a conclusion that this has the potential to ultimately be a good thing for the field of data science. But to get there, we have a lot of work to do. Now that tasks such as writing and scaling up code and fitting models can now be done for us, this leaves us to focus on the more important tasks in data science: critical thinking. The thing that computers can't do for us. And frankly, this is also the thing that most data science educators have been ignoring up until now. Because of the steep learning curve that is required of the coding and the theoretical mathematical and statistical side of data science, most existing books and courses focus on these, without taking the next step of teaching how to actually *think* with data. How to connect our data, and the insights we glean from it, to *reality*.

This is where I plan to pivot.


There used to be a day when the prevailing opinion was that you should not use statistical and machine learning models if you didn't possess a mastery of the theoretical underpinnings of the techniques. Many of us have moved on from that notion: in my opinion, so long as you understand when it is and when it is not appropriate to use these techniques, you don't need to know how to derive all of the asymptotic results that underlie them. I believe that coding will be come similar: since ChatGPT can write much of your code for you, while you do need to be able to check the code and output to ensure that it is doing what you intended, future data scientists may not need to be code masters in the same way that they do today. Especially once we are flush with applications that allow people to simply use the English language to analyze their data: "*Computer, please create a scatterplot of age versus diabetes incidence... Actually can you change that to a barplot?*" 

Too many data scientists today are data "doers" rather than data "thinkers". They know how to work with data but they don't take the time to pause and think about how their data and insights is connected to the real world. Rather than standing on the precipice of our doom, we are standing on the precipice of opportunity. Or at least, that is what I am choosing to believe, because, quite frankly, I don't like the alternative.
